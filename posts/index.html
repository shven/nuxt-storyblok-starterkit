Join one of our [free sessions](http://lunch.designisdead.com/blockchain) or request a [blockchain workshop](http://www.designisdead.com/blockchain)!*\n\nChances are that you’re familiar with counterfeit goods, especially if you like to travel. Wherever you go around the globe, especially China, Turkey or Southeast-Asia, you’ve got a chance to pick up a nice luxury purse or jersey of your favourite sports team at knock-down prices. Should you feel bad now? No not at all! Likely, you wouldn’t have bought the real thing anyway, so Louis Vuitton isn’t going broke anytime soon. More importantly, you were deliberately buying a knock-off.\n\nThe true problem occurs when the consumer has no idea he’s buying counterfeits. The rise of e-commerce giants like Amazon, AliExpress and eBay have opened the door for a new wave of counterfeit goods. Big players like Amazon deny responsibility for the sellers on their platform, law enforcement points the finger to the industries to ensure more preventive measures, who are pointing it right back at the others.\n\nWhile the big boys squabble it out, problems continue to mount in certain industries. Let’s look at the pharmaceutical industry for example, where internet sales account for $75 billion of the counterfeit pharma market ($200 billion total). In developed countries we’re privileged to have good healthcare, the chances that we’ll get a counterfeit from our pharmacist is small, still even in these most secure markets at least 1% of drugs are counterfeit. In developing countries that number quickly rises to 10%-30%, with 16% of counterfeit drugs containing wrong ingredients. In western countries more than 30% of the consumers are concerned about the issues regarding product origin (in any industry) but struggle to act.\n\nAt Design is Dead, we truly believe blockchain got its part to play in this story. Blockchain enables businesses to build trust in their goods, production process and supply chain. Provenance data helps consumers make better choices regarding product quality, authenticity, sustainability, …. Consumer awareness regarding corporate social responsibility has risen dramatically, our infrastructure should follow suit. But why exactly is blockchain a great fit for provenance?\n\nA blockchain is a chronological, historical list of transactions (ledger), these transactions are grouped together in blocks and linked together using cryptography, hence the word blockchain. The information stored on the blockchain is shared and continually reconciled by the participants.",

              "richtext": "To abstract this, imagine you have a list on a piece of paper with 5 friends. Your 5 friends have the exact same list on their own piece of paper. No one in the group can add to or remove items from the list without the agreement of all group members. When a change is agreed upon everyone in the group writes the change down on his paper in the exact same way. If someone tried to cheat, his paper could easily be verified against the other papers in the group.\n\nTo imagine provenance on a blockchain, try placing our abstraction from above into a supply chain context. Likewise, we have a group of participants (e.g. Manufacturer, distributer, pharmacist, patient, … ) and we’ve got items to add to a list: the data of produced pharmaceuticals and its point in the supply chain (Product #, batch #, manufacturer, plant, current owner, …). Whenever a change occurs, all participants must agree. This entails a couple of things:\n\n* A participant cannot send the same drug to two recipients, the others would not agree as they can easily check that the drug is being ‘double spent’.\n* A participant or hacker cannot change the data (manufacturer, owner, …) of an item, he would have to hack a majority of participants on the network so that they would all agree on the change. When a change is submitted and agreed it is sent on the blockchain with a timestamp; making it easy to track historical ownership.\n\nTo concretize everything we’ve talked about we created a quick proof of concept using Hyperledger Composer, a permissioned blockchain solution. We created a network that consists out of four types of participants: manufacturers, distributers, pharmacists and patients. When a participant receives a pharmaceutical (the asset on our blockchain) (s)he can verify the authenticity of the data and origin. When a pharmaceutical is deemed invalid, it is placed in quarantine.\n\nFeel free to [check it out on our GitHub](https://github.com/designisdead/pharmaceuticals-blockchain-poc).

              "richtext": "## The splitting conundrum\n\nMany Scrum Teams have difficulties with splitting user stories. They will often be convinced that it’s absolutely impossible to split this or that product backlog item. As a result, stories that are really oversized enter the sprint and often need to be carried over during multiple sprints because the team doesn’t manage to burn them down in a single iteration. To solve this issue, I‘ve compiled a number of best practices which will should help with the story splitting.\n\nBut first, let’s go back to the WHY of story splitting.\n\n## Why do story splitting?\n\nThe main reasons for story splitting could be summarized as follows:\n\n1)\t**Gain speed by thinking small**: work through several small items instead of a single monolithic one. Each story – regardless of its size – should still be delivering business value. So many small stories will add up to a releasable feature, but each story should be releasable by itself. We will thereby be able to manage our sprint planning better with smaller stories while also generating a smoother burndown pattern. Yes, effective swarming on smaller stories is generally still possible.\n\n2)\t**Increase your overall sprint success rate** by keeping sprint backlog items to a maximum size of roughly 1/5th to 1/6th of your team’s average velocity. Sticking to this size limit for individual stories will help you decrease the risk of getting stuck with “almost finished” stories by the end of the sprint. Your stakeholders will appreciate seeing some working software instead of hearing you almost made it but can’t show anything yet.\n\n3)\t**Increase estimation accuracy** by going for smaller stories. As a rule, the smaller the stories are defined, the easier it will be for the team to evaluate the associated effort and risk and put an estimation on it.\n\n4)\t**Reduce risk**. As already hinted above, the fact that we go from one monolithical item to multiple smaller ones is also a way to reduce the risk considerably. We want to fail faster on a small item and learn from it so that we can avoid making the same mistake with the other items. If we would only have a single big item, then failing to deliver it would most likely be a much more serious setback than having a failed small item, which may even have proven to be recoverable during the same iteration.\n\n5)\t**Improve the Product Owner’s planning options**. By breaking down large items into smaller stories, the PO will also be able to determine better which parts should be prioritized (thinking of minimum viable product) and which parts are best kept for after an initial sprint review feedback round. So the PO gains some flexibility in the way he/she wishes to maximize the user value.\n\n## How NOT to do story splitting\n\nTwo obvious, yet completely incorrect, ways that teams tend to break down large features include:\n\n* Functional decomposition\n* Architectural components\n\nDoing either means you are no longer delivering user value with the completion of each story. Rather, you are creating parts of a larger system that can’t provide value until these are combined with other functional pieces or architectural components. That’s in direct conflict with the agile vision of delivering user value in every iteration and you will have a hard time showing anything during sprint reviews. This in turn will lead to a lack of feedback to improve the product and in the end your delivery will very likely have become very inflexible instead. Don’t do it.\n\nHint: ask yourself if your story definition is still clear on what user value will be delivered for which user type to determine whether you are splitting in the right way.\n\n## Strategies for effective story splitting\n\nOK, so now we know why splitting big stories into smaller ones is preferable and what pitfalls to avoid, but how do we go about this then? Thankfully, the agile community has produced quite a bit of help on this subject. In fact, there’s a wide variety of patterns one can choose from to do story splitting.\n\nRather than duplicate all patterns here, I invite you to read [this excellent article](https://blog.agilistic.nl/10-useful-strategies-for-breaking-down-large-user-stories-and-a-cheatsheet/). You might also want to have a look at [this cheat sheet](https://res.cloudinary.com/dhe4mn6nh/raw/upload/v1503590583/agilisticblog/cheatsheet-10-strategies-for-breaking-down-user-stories.pdf).\n\n## Evaluating the split: what makes a high value story?\n\nIt’s not enough to have this boatload of information on how to split stories. We also want some criteria to determine whether we’ve successfully created smaller stories for which the story definition is of high enough quality.\n\nSo, what are characteristics of a good story? The acronym “INVEST” can help to remind you that good stories are:\n\n**I** – Independent\n\n**N** – Negotiable\n\n**V** – Valuable\n\n**E** – Estimable\n\n**S** – Small\n\n**T** – Testable\n\n**Independent**\n\nStories are easiest to work with if they are independent. That is, we’d like them to not overlap in concept, and we’d like to be able to schedule and implement them in any order. We can’t always achieve this; once in a while we may say things like “3 points for the first report, then 1 point for each of the others.”\n\n**Negotiable** … and Negotiated\n\nA good story is negotiable. It is not an explicit contract for features; rather, details will be co-created by the customer and programmer during development. A good story captures the essence, not the details. Over time, the story may acquire notes, test ideas, and so on, but we don’t need these to prioritize or schedule stories.\n\n**Valuable**\n\nA story needs to be valuable. We don’t care about value to just anybody; it needs to be valuable to the customer. Developers may have (legitimate) concerns, but these should be framed in a way that makes the customer perceive them as important.\n\nThis is especially an issue when splitting stories. Think of a whole story as a multi-layer cake, e.g., a network layer, a persistence layer, a logic layer, and a presentation layer. When we split a story, we’re serving up only part of that cake. We want to give the customer the essence of the whole cake, and the best way is to slice vertically through the layers. Developers often are inclined to work on only one layer at a time (and get it “right”); but a full database layer (for example) has little value to the customer if there’s no presentation layer.\n\n**Estimable**\n\nA good story can be estimated. We don’t need an exact estimate, but just enough to help the customer rank and schedule the story’s implementation. Being estimable is partly a function of being negotiated, as it’s hard to estimate a story we don’t understand. It is also a function of size: bigger stories are harder to estimate. Finally, it’s a function of the team: what’s easy to estimate will vary depending on the team’s experience.\n\nThat said, sometimes a team may have to split a story into a time-boxed “spike” or “POC story” that will give the team enough information to make a decent estimate, and the rest of the story that will actually implement the desired feature.\n\n**Small**\n\nGood stories tend to be small. Stories typically represent at most a few person-days worth of work. Above this size it seems to become too hard to know what’s in the story’s scope. Smaller stories tend to get more accurate estimates. Story descriptions can be small too. Remember, the details can be elaborated through conversations with the customer.\n\n**Testable**\n\nA good story is testable. Writing a story carries an implicit promise: “I understand what I want well enough that I could write a test for it.” Several teams have reported that by requiring customer tests before implementing a story, the team is more productive. “Testability” has always been a characteristic of good requirements: actually writing the tests early helps us know whether this goal is met.\n\nIf a customer doesn’t know how to test something, this may indicate that the story isn’t clear enough, or that it doesn’t reflect something valuable to them, or that the customer just needs help in testing. A team can treat non-functional requirements (such as performance and usability) as things that need to be tested. Figuring out how to operationalize these tests will help the team learn the true needs.\n\nFor all these attributes, the feedback cycle of proposing, estimating, and implementing stories will help teach the team what it needs to know.\n\nHappy splitting everyone!\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThe following authors all inspired this blog post:\n\n[Mark J.

              "richtext": "To tackle these questions, we decided to make a proof of concept that incentivises some internal processes. Along the way we try to engage different team members (designers, UX analysts, full-stack developers). Not only to create an experience that integrates with our current infrastructure and has a low entry barrier, but also to familiarize the team with blockchain in a fun and interactive way. We do have lunch sessions and internal excellence tracks, but nothing beats a real world, tangible example. We settled on two tasks to incentivize as starters: filling in timesheets on time and submitting/reviewing pull requests. The latter was an idea from our full stack team after one of our other internal excellence tracks.\n\n## A unique opportunity\n\nOne of the cool things about blockchain is that the technology has evolved from a payment system (e.g.; Bitcoin) to a full-fledged decentralized computer (e.g. Ethereum). This means that certain blockchains can be programmed with “smart contracts”, a set of conditions recorded on the blockchain so that transactions automatically trigger when the conditions are met. The code can not be changed once deployed onto the blockchain, as a result we do not have to trust a third party to reward us when we meet the conditions described in the contract.\n\nThis is exactly what we are doing with our programmable incentives; sending tokens after someone completes a pre-defined set of conditions that is known to tall parties involved.\n\nIncentives drive behaviour, (open) access to these programmable incentives sets a stage for potential change. We want to thus program incentives that promote positive outcomes in a trustless system: cooperation, equitability and morality.\n\n## Smart Contracts\n\nWe have created three main smarts contracts on our blockchain. The first smart contract, is our very own virtual currency, Knuckles! The knuckles will be our incentive for completing tasks. The smart contract will keep track of the token balances and contains logic for sending tokens to one another.\n\nThe second smart contract is a simple module that allows us to create and remove timesheet administrators, who can then verify and approve submitted timesheets. Users and their manager can see a historical list of processed timesheet periods and their rewards.\n\nOur third and final smart contract is slightly more complex: a bounty hunter game. Our employees already get paid for their work of course, thus the approach is slightly different from some bounties you might encounter in open source projects or open protocols. As a software company with multiple teams we use a versioning tool, called bitbucket, to better organize collaboration. Team members submit pull-requests to projects to upload new code. These requests need to be approved by someone on the team after a code review. When a pull requests gets approved a reward gets sent out to the reviewer for completing this nagging task. If the submitter did a great job and not too many changes are requested, he too gets rewarded.",

I had this experience with Angular 2+ and Adobe Experience Manager (AEM).\n\nBut with the release of Angular 6 they implemented a nice way to convert Angular components into a [custom HTML element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_custom_elements). With this new power it is pretty straight forward to implement Angular components into AEM. In this blog post I will take you through the steps that are needed to implement Angular in an AEM codebase.\n\nI have created a [Github codebase](https://github.com/designisdead/ngx-aem) and tagged all the steps to follow along. I generated a default AEM project with the AEM Maven 11 archetype and added a new maven module called front-end which contains our angular weather component we want to integrate into AEM. To get this code use the tag: [‘0-setup’](https://github.com/designisdead/ngx-aem/tree/0-setup).",

              "richtext": "One thing that we notice in this setup is the path to the assets. In our angular application we mimic the path where it will be on the AEM side. In this case I have chosen to upload my assets to **/etc/designs/ngx/assets**.\n\nNow that we have setup our angular app you can run it by executing the following commands:\n\n~~~\ncd front-end \nng serve\n~~~\n\n## 1. Exposing our component as a custom element\n\nThe first thing we need to do is expose our weather component as a custom element. To start we need to execute the following commands to get the libraries we need:\n\n~~~\nng add @angular/elements \nnpm install @webcomponents/custom-elements --save \nnpm install document-register-element@1.8.1 --save \n~~~\n\nThe first library will add the angular functionality to create custom elements, second library will add polyfills for the browsers that currently do not support custom elements. **Document-register-element** is a stand-alone lightweight version of Custom Elements V1 based on top, and compatible with, the battle-tested Custom Elements V0.\n\n> There is currently a bug in angular elements that it breaks if we try to use a higher version of document-register-element, but in the future, you should be able to use the latest versions.\n\nNext up we need to register the **WeatherComponent** as an **entryComponent** and add the following code to the class **AppModule**:\n\n~~~\nconstructor(private injector: Injector) {}  \n\nngDoBootstrap() {     \n  const weatherElement = createCustomElement(WeatherComponent,{\n    injector: this.injector \n  });     \n  \n  customElements.define('weather-ng', &lt;any>weatherElement); \n} \n~~~\n\nIn this code snippet we inject the angular **Injector** into our **AppModule** instance and register a lifecycle hook that will be called when angular is bootstrapping: **ngDoBootstrap()**. The method **createCustomElement** is part of the @angular/elements library. This method will basically create the correct code to be a custom element. After that follows **customElements.define** where we define what tag this custom element will have in this case it is **weather-ng**. The **customElements** object is available in all major browsers or through the polyfills.\n\nWhen you have done this, you can remove the **bootstrap** part of your module config and in your **index.html** use the tag **weather-ng**.\n\nTag for the code: [1-exposing-the-component](https://github.com/designisdead/ngx-aem/tree/1-exposing-the-component)\n\n## 2. Building and creating a clientlib\n\nThe next step is building our components and creating a clientlib from the exported files. I as well integrated the [maven front-end plugin](https://github.com/eirslett/frontend-maven-plugin) so we can use maven like the rest of the modules.\n\nFirst we need to add the following to the scripts part of the package.json.\n\n~~~\n\"build:elements\": \"ng build --prod --output-hashing none && node elements-build.js\" \n~~~\n\nThis npm script has two parts, the first part will build the Angular components production ready and with no output hashing. After that we use node.js to execute a javascript file. This file is the glue between Angular and AEM. The following code snipped it the **elements-build.js** file:\n\n~~~\nconst fs = require('fs-extra');\r\nconst concat = require('concat');\r\n(async function build() {\r\n  const files = [\r\n    './dist/front-end/runtime.js',\r\n    './dist/front-end/polyfills.js',\r\n    './dist/front-end/scripts.js',\r\n    './dist/front-end/main.js'\r\n  ];\r\n  \r\n  const rootDir = '../ui.apps/src/main/content/jcr_root/etc/designs/ngx';\r\n    \r\n  await fs.ensureDir(`${rootDir}/clientlib-site/js`);\r\n  await fs.ensureDir(`${rootDir}/clientlib-site/css`);\r\n    \r\n  await concat(files, `${rootDir}/clientlib-site/js/ng-aem.js`);\r\n  await fs.copyFile('./dist/front-end/styles.css', `${rootDir}/clientlib-site/css/ng-aem.css`);\r\n    \r\n  await fs.copy('./dist/front-end/etc/designs/ngx/assets/', `${rootDir}/assets`);\r\n  await fs.copy('./dist/front-end/weathericons-regular-webfont.eot', `${rootDir}/clientlib-site/css/weathericons-regular-webfont.eot`);\r\n  await fs.copy('./dist/front-end/weathericons-regular-webfont.svg', `${rootDir}/clientlib-site/css/weathericons-regular-webfont.svg`);\r\n  await fs.copy('./dist/front-end/weathericons-regular-webfont.ttf', `${rootDir}/clientlib-site/css/weathericons-regular-webfont.ttf`);\r\n  await fs.copy('./dist/front-end/weathericons-regular-webfont.woff', `${rootDir}/clientlib-site/css/weathericons-regular-webfont.woff`);\r\n    \r\n  await appendDataIfNotExists(`${rootDir}/clientlib-site/js.txt`, 'ng-aem.js');\r\n  await appendDataIfNotExists(`${rootDir}/clientlib-site/css.txt`, 'ng-aem.css');\r\n    \r\n  console.log(\"Done with moving angular libs to AEM\");\r\n})();\r\n\r\nasync function appendDataIfNotExists(file, toAppend) {\r\n  const data = await fs.readFile(file, 'utf8');\r\n  if (!data.split('\\n').find((val) => val === toAppend)) {\r\n    await fs.writeFile(file,  data + '\\n' + toAppend);\r\n  }\r\n}\n~~~\n\nLet’s list up what this file does in bullet points:\n\n1. It checks if the correct folders exists with: **fs.ensureDir()**\n2. It concatenates all angular javascript files from the build and saves them at the clientlib position\n3. It copies the css file to the clientlib position\n4. It copies the assets to the correct directory\n5. It copies the weather icons font to the css clientlib position\n6. It checks and adds if the clientlib files are added to the **js.txt** and **css.txt**\n7. The last thing it does is log a message that we moved the angular files to AEM\n\nThe last thing to setup to make this process more complete is that we run this script when we run **mvn install**. To do this we use the front-end plugin and add the following configuration to the **pom.xml** of the **front-end** module:\n\n~~~\n&lt;build>\r\n    &lt;plugins>\r\n      &lt;plugin>\r\n        &lt;groupId>com.github.eirslett&lt;/groupId>\r\n        &lt;artifactId>frontend-maven-plugin&lt;/artifactId>\r\n        &lt;version>1.6&lt;/version>\r\n        &lt;configuration>\r\n          &lt;nodeVersion>v10.4.1&lt;/nodeVersion>\r\n        &lt;/configuration>\r\n        &lt;executions>\r\n          &lt;execution>\r\n            &lt;id>install node and npm&lt;/id>\r\n            &lt;goals>\r\n              &lt;goal>install-node-and-npm&lt;/goal>\r\n            &lt;/goals>\r\n            &lt;phase>generate-resources&lt;/phase>\r\n          &lt;/execution>\r\n          &lt;execution>\r\n            &lt;id>npm install&lt;/id>\r\n            &lt;goals>\r\n              &lt;goal>npm&lt;/goal>\r\n            &lt;/goals>\r\n            &lt;phase>generate-resources&lt;/phase>\r\n            &lt;configuration>\r\n              &lt;arguments>install&lt;/arguments>\r\n            &lt;/configuration>\r\n          &lt;/execution>\r\n          &lt;execution>\r\n            &lt;id>npm run build custom elements&lt;/id>\r\n            &lt;goals>\r\n              &lt;goal>npm&lt;/goal>\r\n            &lt;/goals>\r\n            &lt;phase>generate-resources&lt;/phase>\r\n            &lt;configuration>\r\n              &lt;arguments>run build:elements&lt;/arguments>\r\n            &lt;/configuration>\r\n          &lt;/execution>\r\n       &lt;/executions>\r\n     &lt;/plugin>\r\n  &lt;/plugins>\r\n&lt;/build>\n~~~\n\nThis configuration allows you when we use **mvn install** to download node.js and execute the **npm install** command, when this is done it will run the **build:elements** script.\n\nTag for the code: [2-building](https://github.com/designisdead/ngx-aem/tree/2-building)\n\n## 3. Creating the AEM component\n\nWhen we are done building our Angular component we can create an AEM component with it. The weather component in AEM will have a dialog with a selectbox where you can select ‘Kelvin’, ‘Celsius’ or ‘Farenheit’ to display in the weather component. We will as well make it that we can drag and drop other AEM components within our Angular component.\n\nFirst we create the **WeatherModel** sling model in the package **com.did.core.models** with the following code:\n\n~~~\n@Model(adaptables=Resource.class)\r\npublic class WeatherModel {\r\n    \r\n    @Inject\r\n    @Named(\"unitType\")\r\n    @Default(values=\"\")\r\n    private String unitType;\r\n    \r\n    public String getUnitType() {\r\n        return unitType;\r\n    }\r\n    public void setUnitType(String unitType) {\r\n        this.unitType = unitType;\r\n    }\r\n} \n~~~\n\nThe next code snippet is the selectbox part from the dialog:\n\n~~~\n&lt;unitType jcr:primaryType=\"nt:unstructured\" sling:resourceType=\"granite/ui/components/foundation/form/select\" fieldLabel=\"Link Color\" name=\"./unitType\">\r\n  &lt;items jcr:primaryType=\"nt:unstructured\">\r\n    &lt;default jcr:primaryType=\"nt:unstructured\" text=\"Kelvin\" value=\"\"/>\r\n    &lt;metric jcr:primaryType=\"nt:unstructured\" text=\"Celcius\" value=\"metric\"/>\r\n    &lt;imperial jcr:primaryType=\"nt:unstructured\" text=\"Farenheit\" value=\"imperial\"/>\r\n  &lt;/items>\r\n&lt;/unitType>\n~~~\n\nThe last code snippet is from **weather-ng.html** and renders the component in author and publish mode:\n\n~~~\n&lt;div data-sly-test=\"${wcmmode.edit}\">\r\n    &lt;h3>Drag here the components you want to display in your weather component&lt;/h3>\r\n    &lt;div data-sly-resource=\"${'content' @ resourceType='wcm/foundation/components/parsys'}\">&lt;/div>\r\n&lt;/div>\r\n\r\n&lt;weather-ng data-sly-test=\"${wcmmode.disabled}\" data-sly-use.weather=\"com.did.core.models.WeatherModel\" unit=\"${weather.unitType}\">\r\n    &lt;div data-sly-resource=\"${'content' @  resourceType='wcm/foundation/components/parsys'}\">&lt;/div>\r\n&lt;/weather-ng>\n~~~\n\nIn the HTML we have two parts, the first part is when we are on an Author environment. We do not show our angular component here, but we do offer the option to add components to the page within our weather component.\n\nThe second part is only shown when wcm mode is disabled, here you can see our custom element working. The Angular input in the weather component is now an attribute on the element, so we use this to pass the AEM Component config to our Angular component.",

Time to draw my conclusion of integration Angular 6+ into AEM.\n\nI think that it is a success, you can have all the nice features of Angular 6+ and AEM altogether. I mainly liked that I could develop without spinning up my AEM instance unit all the front-end code was done. Through the power of custom elements, it integrates rather easy with AEM. The size of our clientlib is reasonable as well with **268,8 KB** which can be made smaller by using the GZIP feature of AEM clientlibs.\n\nIn the future I will for sure use Angular 6+ again for more complex components in AEM.",

              "richtext": "Our smiley and happy #dreamteam (see groupfie above) was formed by [Johan Cootmans](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johancootmans/) (Program Manager) at the back of the picture, followed by [Jeroen Huys](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeroenhuys/) (Managing Director), [Yoeri Conickx](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yoericonickx/) (Client Service Director) and [Johnny Degreef](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnnydegreef/) (DevOps Engineer).\n\nOn the summit, Adobe partners, customers and prospects, 5000 people in total gather to get inspired by cases, discover new products & features, exchange experiences, partner and get a real non-stop show with a lot of astonishing experiences.\n\nAs every year the Adobe summit becomes a celebration, a full digital and physical experience surrounded by visual shows, projections, huge stages and big screens… everything to create unbeatable experiences. But let’s face it, every company should celebrate their accomplishments together with their partners, customers and prospects… because behind every accomplishment there is an experience, an interaction, a story to share and to learn from.\n\nThere were plenty of break-out sessions on new product features like for AEM and Campaign, several global brands presented how they optimize their customer experience and finally there were sessions on future trends.\n\n> It is really impressive to see how Adobe Sensei is already empowering all modules of the Experience Cloud. On the summit AI became really tangible. It is not a prediction anymore, today AI is reality. We are only at the beginning, but even the sky doesn’t seem to be the limit. – Jeroen Huys\n\n## Alignment with our vision\n\n### Certainty as a service\n\nThis concept, empowered by blockchain, reassured all the investment and efforts that we are making enabling this technology for our customers. You can also check our [blogpost](http://www.designisdead.com/blog/another-blogpost-you-guessed-it-about-blockchain) about blockchain.\n\nIn this context, we are also happy to share our joint collaboration with [Nico Vergauwen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicovergauwen/), Blockchain consultant and founder of [Alt Street](https://altstreet.io/), expert in Smart contracts, Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technology will help our customers to reach the next level of certainty and transparency.\n\nJust contact us if you want to understand better how blockchain can empower your business models.\n\n### DevOps Deciphered\n\nAdobe shared some lessons learned that they observed in some companies that failed applying DevOps and why we should sometimes refer to Development-Operations teams (doing development and giving operational support) instead of using the term DevOps teams.\n\n> Some applications are not suited for DevOps practices. Instead of spending huge amounts of money trying to convert these monolithic products into something flexible (and probably fail after all), you might want to concentrate on decoupling your entire stack as much as possible. This way, you can embrace DevOps in the applications where it’s really useful and where most business value resides, which is typically in the front-end layer. – Johnny Degreef\n\nThey also shared about the CALMS framework, often used in companies that want to adopt DevOps as part of their digital transformation. DevOps is not just about technology or automation, it is much more, and it has to start from a change in culture.\n\n### Adobe Managed Services\n\nAccording to Adobe, 75% of their customers (and they have 600+ customers) are running AEM successfully on Adobe Managed Services (AMS). With Managed Services, Adobe runs and maintains your AEM stack in the cloud and they take care of code deployments, upgrades, … It is very mature and a logical next step for companies still having their AEM running on-premise. The figures pointed out 99,97% uptime average, 8000+ AEM servers managed in a Multi Cloud (Azure & AWS) set-up.\n\nAdobe Managed Services comes with NewRelic as Application Performance Monitoring (APM) tool. This is a cloud tool that **we also use for our customers and we can only applaud that choice.**\n\nKey message in this session was to define your KPI’s clearly from the start of the project. What do want to get out of it? Is it about cost saving or is it more about outsourcing control which is not part of your core business? Depending on these KPI’s, you can decide to go for it, stay on-premise or move to the Cloud without AMS and still stay in control.\n\n### Experience – Technology – Talent\n\n*Making experience your business is good for business.* In order to accomplish this, you need to have the correct **technologies** in place. For this purpose, Adobe has added a new tool built on the Adobe Cloud Platform called Adobe Launch. Launch is the next-generation of Adobe’s tag management technology and you might want to have a look at it. But technology alone does not suffice, you also need to have the right **talent** on board. Attracting talents is probably the biggest challenge in this fast-evolving digital age. And by coincidence, this is the heart of Design Is Dead. We have succeeded in attracting the right talents that can implement the right technology to deliver the right customer experience.\n\n## Take-aways from the summit\n\n1/ The Adobe Summit was again the confirmation and an example to follow regarding digital transformation journeys… Wow! It is admirable to see how Adobe evolved from a graphical solution provider for desktop to an Experience Technology leader provider as pointed out in reports such as Gartner and Forrester. Their organic and inorganic growth strategy is well balanced. They are taking advantage of their marketing knowledge and succeeding at integrating the solutions they acquired (e.g.: Neolane, Day). Well done Adobe!\n\n2/ Experience is everything. And even though during the conference it was (almost) all about the digital experience, it is clear that a company should deliver an overall on- and offline experience. The insights from Virgin Atlantic during the keynote on Thursday is the best proof of this. Deliver the best possible experience (even a small one like a ‘happy birthday’ card on the seat of a passenger), and your brand will grow as well as the customer loyalty. And, definitely, your employees will be happier. Win-win-win-… in every way!\n\nAdobe even launched a new job title! If you want to become an Experience Maker, you can visit their new platform [Experience League](https://landing.adobe.com/experience-league/).\n\n![](http://www.designisdead.com/img/experiencemakers.jpg)\n\n3/ AI is not a hype, it is here to stay, and Adobe is a heavy believer of it. Adobe Sensei is an artificial intelligent system that focusses on making the live of marketeers and creatives easier. Don’t ask Sensei to solve all world problems but will definitely help you to optimize your communication and automate your online presence.\n\n> This summit blew my mind! It had all the necessary ingredients to trigger many thoughts around the current trends in the market and I started wondering: will AI systems take over all parts of the creative and marketing process? To be continued…- Yoeri Conickx\n\nAnd Yoeri promised us a blogpost expanding on these thoughts… stay tuned!",

This hierarchy will allow you to have a clear view of all your marketing automated actions.

Workflows enable users to set up data transformation processes to add new profiles or new transactions.

Here are some of our take aways.*\n\n## Hustlers\n\nThat’s what Kenyans call 83% of the population in contrast of the 17% that has a monthly paycheck in Kenya. These hustlers need an entrepreneurial spirit by necessity.\n\nThat part of their cultural DNA was very strongly present when I talked to them during the visit and it is a good fit for the startup mentality.\n\n## Mobile\n\nThere are things Kenya beats the entire world. 83% percent of the total internet traffic comes over mobile devices. An anecdote of one of the mission participants highlighted that some Kenyan are even amazed if they learn you can surf the web via a desktop or laptop.\n\nMobile payments are ubiquitous amongst the people who have a cellphone, most of which are still using a sms-toolkit.   \nAbsolute market leader in those Mobile Payment is Safricom’s M-Pesa (literally Mobile Money)\n\n## Handling a day by day budget\n\nMost Kenyans cannot afford making investments to improve their life, like getting on the electricity grid or even a small solar panel.\n\nThat’s why most startups have some kind of payment plan after which the product becomes the ownership of the subscriber.  \nSee for example [M-Kopa Solar](http://www.m-kopa.com/) and [PayGo Energy](https://www.paygoenergy.co/) who want to help Kenyans go away from buying small amounts of low quality kerosine for their energy needs.\n\n## Bridging the divide\n\nThis is the slogan of our partner Close the Gap and most startups are actually helping with that mission through entrepreneurship. The obvious tool is education which Close the Gap enables by providing ICT material to for instance Computers for School Kenya and designing digitrucks (see top image).  \nStartups active in this category are [Kytabu](http://kytabu.com/) (digitizing school books) and [Ewela](http://elewa.co.ke/) (changing the education approach).\n\n[Sophiebot](http://sophiebot.tk/) addresses one of the more challenging topics to be handled in the classroom: sexual reproductive health. Fuelled by artificial intelligence is has a direct positive impact on a major health issue in the region.\n\nHaving an address seems normal to us in the western world and we don’t realize that not having one could be the difference between life or death when an ambulance can not find your location. That is what [OkHi](http://www.okhi.com/) aims to solve. A drought can have a massive impact on the yield of crops, what if we can activate the natural response system of those crops so they are more resilient. [Fyteko](http://fyteko.com/) does exactly that.\n\nThis was an inspiring experience to a part of the world that is still sometimes overlooked when it comes to digital innovation, clearly unrightfully so. We would like to thank our partner [Close the Gap](http://close-the-gap.org/) and [Startups.be](https://startups.be/) for organising the Mission and given us the opportunity to participate.\n\nIf you like to see some pictures and learn more check our [facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/DesignisDead/) for the daily posts we did.

Personalisation is a must to engage with your audience.*\n\nI worked as a researcher since 2005 till 1015 in the world of Technology Enhanced Learning. Yes, this field is about how to improve learning using technology. I can still remember my first project: [TENCOMPETENCE](https://www.openeducationeuropa.eu/en/project/tencompetence). Already then, words such as “personalisation” and “adaptation” were constantly used during the project. We all shared the dream of fully personalised learning journeys for every student, every person, for the rest of their lives: lifelong learning. But I must say that the access that marketing has nowadays is hardly comparable to what we had access at that moment.\n\nWe will avoid going into semantics as we can start a whole dissertation discussing the differences between personalisation and adaptation can be understood differently. In this [paper](http://info.iicm.tu-graz.ac.at/www/Research/Publications/2005/_id187c3_/iknow05_personalisation/iknow05_personalisation.pdf), some folks from the University of Graz define personalisation as part of adaptation, and in this [blog](https://devnet.kentico.com/articles/personalization-101--types-of-personalization), [Thomas Robbins](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thom-robbins-7888486/) working with [Kentico](https://www.kentico.com/) at that moment and now Chief Marketing Manager of MediaPro, defined adaptation as a type of personalisation.\n\nThomas Robbins explains that we have two/three types of personalisation:\n\n* Prescriptive personalisation: Prescriptive personalization is rule based and triggered by interactions with a user.\n  * Explicit personalisation: Personalisation is done based on the data of the user profile.\n  * Implicit personalisation: We still have rules but are based on the behaviour of the user (e.g. clicks, visited resources, …)\n* Adaptive personalisation: In this one, we take some distance from rule-based personalisation and we dive into automatic personalisation based on behaviour prediction.\n\nMost of the DXP support explicit personalisation nowadays. Less DXP support implicit personalisation and even less support adaptive personalisation.\n\nWith Adobe Experience Cloud we have the right tooling to experiment and make progress on this journey as I partially explained in my last blog post: “[Enabling marketing experimentation with Adobe Target](http://www.designisdead.com/blog/enabling-marketing-experimentation-with-adobe-target)”.\n\nAdobe Experience Cloud enables you to start from a simple explicit personalisation and accompanies you in the journey towards fully adaptive personalisation.\n\nHow can a journey for your company?\n\n1. You can start with Adobe Experience Manager and [ContextHub](https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/6-3/sites/developing/using/contexthub.html) (out-of-the-box functionality).\n\nThis functionality enables to hook up your CRM or your user profile database to\timport your segments and personalise your content. At this level, we would be at the level of explicit personalisation. This is the level supported by most of the CMSs.\n\n1. The second natural step is Adobe Target. With Adobe target, you can perform [A/B and multivariate testing](http://www.designisdead.com/blog/enabling-marketing-experimentation-with-adobe-target). Adobe Target has a functionality that is “[Auto-allocate](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/target/target/automated_traffic_allocation.html)” that determines the winner of your experiment and automatically reallocates more traffic to the most successful scenario.\n\nYou can also use audience data collected by [Analytics](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/target/target/c_audiences.html) for real-time targeting and personalization in Adobe Target.\n\nAt this level, we could say that we are doing something similar to implicit personalisation, especially, when we plug Analytics data.\n\n1. The third step is to disclose the full potential of Adobe Target and its [automated personalisation features](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/target/target/t_automated_personalization.html) using [Random Forest](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/target/beta/target/c_algo_random_forest.html) to predict user behaviour.\n\nYou can also read a bit further here about [products recommendations](http://www.adobe.com/be_en/marketing-cloud/target/product-recommendations.html) and [automated personalisation](http://www.adobe.com/be_en/marketing-cloud/target/automated-personalization.html).\n\nAt this level, we would be clearly talking about adaptive personalisation.\n\nOnce the last step is reached, you might find the challenge of providing enough quality for all your personas. As discussed by [Bridget Roman](https://theblog.adobe.com/adobe-target-aem-livefyre-help-win-personalization-game-every-time/), senior product marketing manager for Adobe Experience Manager Livefyre, many companies do not have neither the budget nor the time to generate enough content quality to address all the customer segments that they have. Therefore, mastering user generated content can become a really valuable asset to engage but also to provide personalised experiences that consequently will raise the engagement. Livefyre can be a clear differentiator for your business when you use it correctly.\n\nIf you want to continue the discussion about all the possibilities of the Adobe Experience Cloud, do not hesitate to [contact me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jlsantoso/)!",

              "richtext": "*Dear Marketeers, please do experiment. With the right tooling (e.g. Adobe Target), process (e.g. SCRUM) and planning tool (e.g. JIRA), you can start your endeavour in the experimentation world.*\n\nExperimentation is an inherent part of data driven marketing. Most of the DXP platforms have content targeting functionality. But many marketers face the frustration that once they target their content, they do not achieve the expected engagement. Surely, they can re-target their content again and see if the second time they are luckier. They might learn from the experience, but next time, they might fail again because the lessons learned were not the right ones.\n\nI am a big fan of the website called [Spurious correlations](http://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations). We can see quite funny correlations there such as US spending on science, space and technology and the suicides by hanging, strangulation and suffocation. Those analyses confirm the danger of data misuse as well as the well-known rule that correlation doesn’t mean causality. Such a website pushes correlations out of the common-sense limits. However, we can constantly see people experimenting with designs and comparing unrelated data.\n\nContextual information is vital for the correct analysis of data. And, if we want to minimise the impact of the context, we should conduct more formal experiments.\n\nProbably you are familiar with the A/B and multivariate testing. Nowadays we have wonderful tools that allow you to experiment. Our favourite is [Adobe Target](http://www.adobe.com/be_en/marketing-cloud/target/ab-testing.html), but indeed, you can check also others such as [VWO](https://vwo.com/ab-testing/).\n\nAnd why do we like Adobe? Well… you know about our weakness for JAVA. Our DXP of choice is Adobe Experience Manager (AEM), a JAVA product. AEM integrates flawlessly with products from the Adobe Experience Cloud such as Target and Analytics. But most importantly, we can bring our expertise building JAVA middleware layers to communicate with other components, activity that our developers thrive for it. Reactive programming, functional programming and other paradigms are increasing the possibilities within the JAVA landscape.\n\n### What do I personally like Adobe Target?\n\nThe possibilities of setting up your own experiments. For example, you can try your new design with only 20% of your visitors. But Adobe target can automatically adapt this percentage based on the success of your experiment, ending targeting the best content to the right audience.\n\nHow powerful is when plugged in with [Adobe Analytics](http://www.adobe.com/be_en/marketing-cloud/target/analytics-enhanced-reporting.html). You can target one audience for your specific experiment as well as getting enhanced reports thanks to the information of both components.\n\n### How do we learn from it?\n\nBesides the lack of rigorous analysis, there is usually another common problem. Marketing teams lack a process to share knowledge, a space where design, reasoning and findings of the experiments can be discussed. And let’s admit it, this is sometimes difficult even in research environments.\n\nIn this context, we recommend agile frameworks such as SCRUM that can give windows of 1, 2 or 4 weeks for marketing teams to experiment. We also suggest the use of a log book. Software such as JIRA offers the possibility to fully customise your tickets.\n\nTherefore, with the right tooling (e.g. Adobe Target), process (e.g. SCRUM) and planning tool (e.g. JIRA), marketing teams can start their endeavour in their experimentation world.\n\nAny questions? Just ask.\n\n*This is part of a series of posts that we started with “[2018, an exciting year](http://www.designisdead.com/blog/2008-an-exciting-year)” and “[Another blogpost –you guessed it- about Blockchain](http://www.designisdead.com/blog/another-blogpost-you-guessed-it-about-blockchain)”*\n\n## Log Book example",

E.g; on a blog page, there can be funny, sad and serious announcements. You could use the style system to easily accomplish this.\n\nThe style system renders the paintbrush icon on the action bar of a component.

The most popular in Belgium are: [Blockchain Brussels](https://www.meetup.com/Blockchain-Brussels/), [Blockchain Vlaanderen](https://www.meetup.com/blockchain-vlaanderen/) and [Hive Blockchain Society](https://www.meetup.com/HIVE_Blockchain_Society/).

But it’s far from reality. Blockchain is more than cryptocurrency. \n\nIn this world, with a very strong movement in favour of healthier food consumption, blockchain is penetrating strongly. We can find several examples in the food industry such as:\n\n* [Provenance](https://www.provenance.org/whitepaper) : a website that proposes Blockchain as the solution for transparency in product supply chains.\n* [ZhongAn](https://www.fastcompany.com/40515999/in-china-you-can-track-your-chicken-on-you-guessed-it-the-blockchain) : besides inspiring us for the title, this article explains how ZhongAn developed this blockchain technology to track the origin of the chickens.\n* [WWF](https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/100386866/wwf-uses-blockchain-to-improve-transparency-in-tuna-industry): Same than ZhongAn, but proposing the tracking of tuna.\n\n*So what is happening in Belgium?*\n\n* Vrije Universiteit Brussel started their own project: [NRGcoin](http://www.nrgcoin.org/) — Smart Contract for green energy.\n* [WeTrade](https://we-trade.com/): and indeed, it’s about trading. And KBC is playing a role there.\n* [Port of Antwerp](http://www.t-mining.be/): where they are using to track that containers end up in the hands of the rightful truck driver.\n\nSome people though argues that Belgium might be lagging behind in BlockChain projects. You can check this enriching [discussion](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6347361282617860098/) started by Laurens van Reiijen.\n\nBut this is not all… we recently learned that IBM and Danish shipping giant Maersk are starting a [New York-based venture](http://fortune.com/2018/01/16/ibm-blockchain-maersk-company/).\n\nLong story short, Blockchain is about tracing the story of something in a transparent, uncorrupted and reliable way.\n\nDo you need a deeper understanding of the technology? Just ask and let’s share our crypto-journey!\n\n**Note 1: are you a Blockchain developer? We are [recruiting](http://www.designisdead.com/jobs/blockchain-developer)!** **Note 2: This is part of a series of posts that we started with “[2018, an exciting year](http://www.designisdead.com/blog/2008-an-exciting-year)”.

This is the year of personalised journeys, BlockChain, AR/VR, IoT, etc. Yes, we know… they are not new concepts but their adoption is far from what it should be.\n\n*And with excitement, some challenges come along too…*\n\nPenetration of offshore companies in the **Belgian market** is going to increase. Jean-Francois Aernouts, Trade Commissioner in the Consulate-General of Belgium in Chennai, reported to [thehindu.com](http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/belgium-has-lots-to-offer-to-indian-companies/article19716609.ece), that they want to position **Brussels** as the ideal place for Indian companies willing to expand.\n\nThis will encourage local players to **differentiate** from these global players that look at first sight very cost-attractive.\n\n*Who are the traditional roles that companies such as Design is Dead approach?*\n\n[According to Gartner’s report](https://www.gartner.com/doc/3803526/cio-agenda-mastering-new-job) “Mastering the New Business Executive Job of the CIO”, the role of the **CIO** is shifting from an IT-outcome-focused role to a **business-outcome-focused** role.\n\nConsequence of this shift, we observe how the priorities for 2017/2018 are purely business oriented: Growing market share and **Digital Transformation**. We can surely identify the traditional cost optimisation, but the main focus is increasing the profit and revenue of the company.\n\nThe same report explains how the CIO is becoming the **liaison** between business departments and an enabler of the digital transformation. This explains why growing the market share and enabling digital transformation are on the top.\n\n[Adobe’s CMO survey](https://cmosurvey.org/results) reports a **CMO** who is assuming more responsibilities within the company.\n\nThe following priorities are identified in the survey: 1) the acquisition of new customers; 2) increase the customer purchase volume; 3) purchase of related products and services; 4) customer retention; 5) entry of new customers into market; and 6) price per unit.\n\nSurely, these priorities shift by industries and markets. For example, we see that manufacturing and services will focus on increasing the customer purchase volume. Obviously, those industries that have a low conversion rate and high acquisition costs will focus on maximising accounts instead of acquiring new ones.\n\n*How is Design is Dead going to help companies in 2018?*\n\n* Enabling **scientific experimentation** for marketing departments\n* Enabling personalised journeys with **AEM**\n* Becoming an enabler for customers who want to dive into technologies such as **Blockchain, Machine Learning, Big Data and IoT**\n\nAnd we will make sure to expand every point in the following blog posts.\n\nAny question? Just ask.",

Beside the traditional job postings, it was time for us to find other ways to attract new colleagues. Hence, we decided to join the battle for new talent at schools.\n\nAfter conversations with KULeuven and PXL in Hasselt, we got an invitation to be part as an external jury in the students’ thesis defences that we kindly accepted. Three brave souls of the DID team wrestled through all the defence scripts to find their favourite projects to attend and participate as jury. So on Monday 19/06, Wednesday 21/06 and Friday 23/06 each of us attended 5 very diverse and very interesting defences going from pure software development to drones, domotics and server management. After all defences we participated to the deliberation and provided our score and motivation.\n\nAs our next mission in the battle for new talent, we are also attending and organising meetups. These are an excellent opportunity to introduce ourselves and Design is Dead. Moreover, we are launching other initiatives like internships to work with us on our interesting and diverse projects as well as co-supervision of master (or bachelor) theses together with universities.\n\nInterested to have a chat with us? Check our [open positions](http://www.designisdead.com/jobs/) or just contact us at [jobs@designisdead.com](mailto:jobs@designisdead.com).\n\n*Btw, we are going to be present at the handshake event on Tuesday, 03-10-2017 @ PXL.

              "richtext": "Over the last decade, I experienced a good change in the recruitment process. Before, your seniority was mainly measured by the number of certificates you received. Today it is no longer the only tool to determine if a candidate will deliver what he promises.\n\n## Improved recruitment at Design Is Dead\n\nAt Design Is Dead, recruitment has shifted gears. We aim to make the recruitment as light as possible.\n\n1. Candidates submit their application.\n2. If the candidate claims to have experience and knowledge in his CV, we invite the candidate for an interview.\n3. We usually conduct a very informal interview, but technical questions are asked while the candidate is discussing her/his CV. Therefore, the technical questions are related to real use cases that the candidate faced. We can assess her or his skills to explain the problem, the thinking process to find a solution, and the technical knowledge acquired after the process.\n\nThe interview proved to be a valuable tool to assess the fit of the candidate. However, the process gets more complicated when you see that based on purely skills, the candidate is not the right match, but s/he has the right attitude and shows a lot of potential.\n\nIf both parts believe that they can still be a match, the candidate receives an open assignment with little requirements, for instance a REST API written in Java and consumed in a javascript framework of choice. The candidate gets a few weeks to solve this.\n\nAfter submission of the project and review by a few senior team members, the candidate is invited for a second interview to have a discussion on the work he delivered, how he tackled any problems he encountered and how he dealt with new things. Questions go deep to get a better idea of the understanding of the topic at hand, and we, proactively, give feedback to the candidate.\n\nIn the end, why shouldn’t an interview be a learning experience?\n\nThis approach has allowed us to find some promising candidates. During the interview, the candidate has to put his money where his mouth is. And, even if the candidate fails, we can contribute to her or his learning process.\n\nAs [Jeroen](https://be.linkedin.com/in/jeroenhuys) (the boss ;)) says, it is all about people and as a company we should aim to have (in addition to results) a positive impact on the society at large.\n\n## What has this to do with certification?\n\nI have a background as a tutor at the engineering faculty of a Belgian university. In this function, I examined students on their final projects. The final mark was based on the delivered work, but also on the understanding of the covered material during an oral examination. Over the years I developed a sixth sense to distinguish the shy but intelligent student from the loud and nonsense type. It has been proven that only a written exam does not give a complete overview of skills and knowledge of each student.\n\nEvery single time I did a certification exam, I managed to pass, just barely but I passed. Every time I exited the testing center, I felt underrated because these exams do not include a practical part, just like the hiring process or the evaluations I used to do at the university. These exams only test the knowledge you know by heart. So anyone with a great memory but low understanding of the subject has a reasonable chance to pass the certification exam.\n\n## What’s the alternative?\n\nThat’s a hard one. Having a one-to-one conversation as part of the certification is very intensive, both for the examiner and the examinee. It is also expensive for the company issuing the certification. And finally, these assignments are hard to re-use. Believe me, students are experts in compiling all exam assignments of the past years.\n\nAn other approach is how we do things at Design Is Dead. A certification is considered as proof of knowledge. In a interview we check how the candidate applied his knowledge in the past and how he will solve problems using his aquired knowledge.\n\nNevertheless, it is worthwhile to rethink the certification process. Although computer-based tests are time-savers, they still miss some part of the skills of the candidate.",

              "richtext": "Last week was exciting at Design is Dead. We interviewed many UX designers for one of our new positions. We were looking for a creative, but also functional thinking candidate. Someone who designs fancy, but doable interfaces.\n\nI personally got impressed when getting the explanation of [Atomic Design](http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/) from one of our candidates. He showed passion while he was explaining it and he definitely wanted to capture my attention.\n\nHowever, it was a bit surprising that nobody raised any framework or data-informed approach to the question: how do you start the design of an interface?\n\nThere is a big debate about the [downsides](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/data-informed-design-data-driven-neil-turner) of relying only on data. However, sometimes it scares me that we leave our decisions to our gut feelings instead of structuring better our thinking process.\n\nIn my opinion, the UX designs are most of the times the real start of the requirements. That’s the reason why we usually recommend to our customers start with a workshop.\n\nThe design thinking process is becoming very popular. But, in the definition of the problem, we recommend to spend time on the metrics that we‘ll track after the product launch. I know I know… as the folks from UX studio share, sometimes we also do it after launching the product. Sometimes, the clients do not want this kind of brainstorming earlier and they want the product.\n\nWhen defining the metrics, it is always better to rely on existing frameworks. For that, the [HEART framework](https://library.gv.com/how-to-choose-the-right-ux-metrics-for-your-product-5f46359ab5be) is a very useful tool. It helps us to focus on the priorities, but, even more important, at which stage we can start evaluating the product. Specially, when we can involve end-customers at early stage of the product and we start talking about CX instead of UX.\n\nThis process helps us to put especial emphasis on the call to actions and prioritise goals. I loved the article from [Tom Goodwin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomfgoodwin) entitled [“Is data killing advertisement?”](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/data-killing-advertising-tom-goodwin).\n\n> “Attribution should be about establishing success and growing the business. However, the entire practice has become about capturing — not creating — success.” — [Tom Goodwin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomfgoodwin)\n\nAnd finally, we raise the final questions: Where does the customer journey start? How can we provide seamless customer journeys jumping from one channel to another? From a shop to the e-shop, from a TV advertisement to buying a 50K € car before the customer loses her engagement, …\n\n**Remember:** [Our decisions are emotional](https://medium.com/startup-grind/strategic-brand-messaging-5-truths-a-framework-c33831f0504c), so reach your customer beyond logic.\n\nAre you interested? just drop us a message and start brainstorming together.\n\n*We also published this blog post on our DID publication in Medium - Visit it [here](https://medium.com/designisdead/the-challenge-omnichannel-experiences-8f1ceaeff03)*",

On the same square as the church appeared to be the headquarters of the winning party and so we did discover how Maltese people celebrate when they win the elections, being with a lot of noise and smoke. 2 days later we knew that they celebrate multiple days.\n\nA wedding party during the day, for us, Belgians, that’s quit unusual. So we were not the first on the dance floor. That was on the credit of the South-Europeans. However we did take over! With style!\n\nThe last day of our trip a treasure hunt was organized in Valletta. And who was also present? Some ten thousands of Maltese people celebrating the elections.",

              "richtext": "> Integration creates a bright united future for its offices in Ghent, Antwerp and New York\n\n## The Reference announces it integrates the 20 creative talents of Design is Dead in its team. It also adds the agency clients and goodwill of its Antwerp-based sister company of Emakina Group. Design is Dead is very much alive and kicking and now fully focuses on enterprise platform integration, application building and ICT-advice.\n\nThe integration of the 20 coworkers of the creative cell is a logical step for both organisations, after successful joint projects on clients like Bekaert, Auping and LolaLiza. The Reference strengthens its full service digital offering with extra conceptual and creative talents who deliver bold communication for brands as Ann Demeulemeester, Come a casa, Concertgebouw Brugge, Jules Destrooper, Brugge Tripel and Auping. This team now becomes part of a bigger international venture, with top experts in digital-first multichannel services and technologies.\n\nThe digital team of Design is Dead in Brussels is no part of this integration. The 25 ICT professionals each have over 10 years of experience in the development and maintenance of enterprise web applications. They work in agile teams with a relentless focus on DevOps. MD Jeroen Huys autonomously expands this line of business under the current brand name Design is Dead.\n\nWith the Design is Dead creative power joining in, the company headquartered in Ghent now grows to 140 consultants in total, operating from three locations. Besides the economy of scale and obvious synergies between the talented teams, the positive ‘click’ between the people involved made this a logical and natural decision. Also, clients react enthusiastically as they can clearly see the added value of the joint expertise.\n\n### Anja Cappelle, MD of The Reference:\n\n“We wish a warm welcome to our Antwerp colleagues! Together we will generate high tangible business results for our clients. I look forward to seeing our combined skills and energy at work, at the intersection of marketing and technology. After opening our New York office, this is a new milestone for our company: this integration makes us stronger than ever, our united future is bright.”\n\n### Jeroen Huys, MD of Design is Dead:\n\n“The Reference will be ideal context for our creative colleagues to fully develop their talents and put them at the disposal of interesting clients. We wish them all the best. For Design is Dead a new chapter begins, one that we have already been silently writing with a lot of success for the last 10 years. As a reliable enterprise solutions partner we are ready to share our vast experience with top organizations looking for IT advise, platform integration & full stack custom built Java development.”\n\n#### About THE REFERENCE\n\nIt’s more than digital, it’s your business.

Early adopters bring in new and exciting ideas, we challenge them with many years of e-service integration experience before they’re proposed and implemented, so the clients reap all the benefits. Big organizations always had issues with this.\n\nAs of late, we leveraged earlier POCs around [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) and the recently released [Angular 2](https://angular.io/). Today we use them in corporate environments, on par with the adoption rate within startup environments.\n\nWe don’t employ new technologies just for the sake of it, but we test their benefits and note them in our POC results. The shown webpack increased quality, modularity and performance.\n\nOnce implemented, we test the results again to learn from the positive and the less positive results. We use this agile approach on our own initiatives as well, so we apply what we preach.",

Join one of our [free sessions](http://lunch.designisdead.com/blockchain) or request a [blockchain workshop](http://www.designisdead.com/blockchain)!*\n\nChances are that you’re familiar with counterfeit goods, especially if you like to travel. Wherever you go around the globe, especially China, Turkey or Southeast-Asia, you’ve got a chance to pick up a nice luxury purse or jersey of your favourite sports team at knock-down prices. Should you feel bad now? No not at all! Likely, you wouldn’t have bought the real thing anyway, so Louis Vuitton isn’t going broke anytime soon. More importantly, you were deliberately buying a knock-off.\n\nThe true problem occurs when the consumer has no idea he’s buying counterfeits. The rise of e-commerce giants like Amazon, AliExpress and eBay have opened the door for a new wave of counterfeit goods. Big players like Amazon deny responsibility for the sellers on their platform, law enforcement points the finger to the industries to ensure more preventive measures, who are pointing it right back at the others.\n\nWhile the big boys squabble it out, problems continue to mount in certain industries. Let’s look at the pharmaceutical industry for example, where internet sales account for $75 billion of the counterfeit pharma market ($200 billion total). In developed countries we’re privileged to have good healthcare, the chances that we’ll get a counterfeit from our pharmacist is small, still even in these most secure markets at least 1% of drugs are counterfeit. In developing countries that number quickly rises to 10%-30%, with 16% of counterfeit drugs containing wrong ingredients. In western countries more than 30% of the consumers are concerned about the issues regarding product origin (in any industry) but struggle to act.\n\nAt Design is Dead, we truly believe blockchain got its part to play in this story. Blockchain enables businesses to build trust in their goods, production process and supply chain. Provenance data helps consumers make better choices regarding product quality, authenticity, sustainability, …. Consumer awareness regarding corporate social responsibility has risen dramatically, our infrastructure should follow suit. But why exactly is blockchain a great fit for provenance?\n\nA blockchain is a chronological, historical list of transactions (ledger), these transactions are grouped together in blocks and linked together using cryptography, hence the word blockchain. The information stored on the blockchain is shared and continually reconciled by the participants.",component:"richtext",textalignment:"left",_editable:'\x3c!--#storyblok#{"name": "richtext", "space": "44470", "uid": "adda2271-96d3-492a-9ba4-1fd5ea998249", "id": "215843"}--\x3e'},{alt:"Blockchain blocks",_uid:"12e35f43-d9a8-4e0d-b915-256e05b46e80",image:"//a.storyblok.com/f/44470/799x265/cba7ea0da0/blockchain-blocks.png",width:"",alignment:"center",component:"imageupload",_editable:'\x3c!--#storyblok#{"name": "imageupload", "space": "44470", "uid": "12e35f43-d9a8-4e0d-b915-256e05b46e80", "id": "215843"}--\x3e'},{_uid:"e54acb2e-4215-45b0-8962-773bb02efb2e",richtext:"To abstract this, imagine you have a list on a piece of paper with 5 friends. Your 5 friends have the exact same list on their own piece of paper. No one in the group can add to or remove items from the list without the agreement of all group members. When a change is agreed upon everyone in the group writes the change down on his paper in the exact same way. If someone tried to cheat, his paper could easily be verified against the other papers in the group.\n\nTo imagine provenance on a blockchain, try placing our abstraction from above into a supply chain context. Likewise, we have a group of participants (e.g. Manufacturer, distributer, pharmacist, patient, … ) and we’ve got items to add to a list: the data of produced pharmaceuticals and its point in the supply chain (Product #, batch #, manufacturer, plant, current owner, …). Whenever a change occurs, all participants must agree. This entails a couple of things:\n\n* A participant cannot send the same drug to two recipients, the others would not agree as they can easily check that the drug is being ‘double spent’.\n* A participant or hacker cannot change the data (manufacturer, owner, …) of an item, he would have to hack a majority of participants on the network so that they would all agree on the change. When a change is submitted and agreed it is sent on the blockchain with a timestamp; making it easy to track historical ownership.\n\nTo concretize everything we’ve talked about we created a quick proof of concept using Hyperledger Composer, a permissioned blockchain solution. We created a network that consists out of four types of participants: manufacturers, distributers, pharmacists and patients. When a participant receives a pharmaceutical (the asset on our blockchain) (s)he can verify the authenticity of the data and origin. When a pharmaceutical is deemed invalid, it is placed in quarantine.\n\nFeel free to [check it out on our GitHub](https://github.com/designisdead/pharmaceuticals-blockchain-poc).

They will often be convinced that it’s absolutely impossible to split this or that product backlog item. As a result, stories that are really oversized enter the sprint and often need to be carried over during multiple sprints because the team doesn’t manage to burn them down in a single iteration. To solve this issue, I‘ve compiled a number of best practices which will should help with the story splitting.\n\nBut first, let’s go back to the WHY of story splitting.\n\n## Why do story splitting?\n\nThe main reasons for story splitting could be summarized as follows:\n\n1)\t**Gain speed by thinking small**: work through several small items instead of a single monolithic one. Each story – regardless of its size – should still be delivering business value. So many small stories will add up to a releasable feature, but each story should be releasable by itself. We will thereby be able to manage our sprint planning better with smaller stories while also generating a smoother burndown pattern. Yes, effective swarming on smaller stories is generally still possible.\n\n2)\t**Increase your overall sprint success rate** by keeping sprint backlog items to a maximum size of roughly 1/5th to 1/6th of your team’s average velocity. Sticking to this size limit for individual stories will help you decrease the risk of getting stuck with “almost finished” stories by the end of the sprint. Your stakeholders will appreciate seeing some working software instead of hearing you almost made it but can’t show anything yet.\n\n3)\t**Increase estimation accuracy** by going for smaller stories. As a rule, the smaller the stories are defined, the easier it will be for the team to evaluate the associated effort and risk and put an estimation on it.\n\n4)\t**Reduce risk**. As already hinted above, the fact that we go from one monolithical item to multiple smaller ones is also a way to reduce the risk considerably. We want to fail faster on a small item and learn from it so that we can avoid making the same mistake with the other items. If we would only have a single big item, then failing to deliver it would most likely be a much more serious setback than having a failed small item, which may even have proven to be recoverable during the same iteration.\n\n5)\t**Improve the Product Owner’s planning options**. By breaking down large items into smaller stories, the PO will also be able to determine better which parts should be prioritized (thinking of minimum viable product) and which parts are best kept for after an initial sprint review feedback round. So the PO gains some flexibility in the way he/she wishes to maximize the user value.\n\n## How NOT to do story splitting\n\nTwo obvious, yet completely incorrect, ways that teams tend to break down large features include:\n\n* Functional decomposition\n* Architectural components\n\nDoing either means you are no longer delivering user value with the completion of each story. Rather, you are creating parts of a larger system that can’t provide value until these are combined with other functional pieces or architectural components. That’s in direct conflict with the agile vision of delivering user value in every iteration and you will have a hard time showing anything during sprint reviews. This in turn will lead to a lack of feedback to improve the product and in the end your delivery will very likely have become very inflexible instead. Don’t do it.\n\nHint: ask yourself if your story definition is still clear on what user value will be delivered for which user type to determine whether you are splitting in the right way.\n\n## Strategies for effective story splitting\n\nOK, so now we know why splitting big stories into smaller ones is preferable and what pitfalls to avoid, but how do we go about this then? Thankfully, the agile community has produced quite a bit of help on this subject. In fact, there’s a wide variety of patterns one can choose from to do story splitting.\n\nRather than duplicate all patterns here, I invite you to read [this excellent article](https://blog.agilistic.nl/10-useful-strategies-for-breaking-down-large-user-stories-and-a-cheatsheet/). You might also want to have a look at [this cheat sheet](https://res.cloudinary.com/dhe4mn6nh/raw/upload/v1503590583/agilisticblog/cheatsheet-10-strategies-for-breaking-down-user-stories.pdf).\n\n## Evaluating the split: what makes a high value story?\n\nIt’s not enough to have this boatload of information on how to split stories. We also want some criteria to determine whether we’ve successfully created smaller stories for which the story definition is of high enough quality.\n\nSo, what are characteristics of a good story? The acronym “INVEST” can help to remind you that good stories are:\n\n**I** – Independent\n\n**N** – Negotiable\n\n**V** – Valuable\n\n**E** – Estimable\n\n**S** – Small\n\n**T** – Testable\n\n**Independent**\n\nStories are easiest to work with if they are independent. That is, we’d like them to not overlap in concept, and we’d like to be able to schedule and implement them in any order. We can’t always achieve this; once in a while we may say things like “3 points for the first report, then 1 point for each of the others.”\n\n**Negotiable** … and Negotiated\n\nA good story is negotiable. It is not an explicit contract for features; rather, details will be co-created by the customer and programmer during development. A good story captures the essence, not the details. Over time, the story may acquire notes, test ideas, and so on, but we don’t need these to prioritize or schedule stories.\n\n**Valuable**\n\nA story needs to be valuable. We don’t care about value to just anybody; it needs to be valuable to the customer. Developers may have (legitimate) concerns, but these should be framed in a way that makes the customer perceive them as important.\n\nThis is especially an issue when splitting stories. Think of a whole story as a multi-layer cake, e.g., a network layer, a persistence layer, a logic layer, and a presentation layer. When we split a story, we’re serving up only part of that cake. We want to give the customer the essence of the whole cake, and the best way is to slice vertically through the layers. Developers often are inclined to work on only one layer at a time (and get it “right”); but a full database layer (for example) has little value to the customer if there’s no presentation layer.\n\n**Estimable**\n\nA good story can be estimated. We don’t need an exact estimate, but just enough to help the customer rank and schedule the story’s implementation. Being estimable is partly a function of being negotiated, as it’s hard to estimate a story we don’t understand. It is also a function of size: bigger stories are harder to estimate. Finally, it’s a function of the team: what’s easy to estimate will vary depending on the team’s experience.\n\nThat said, sometimes a team may have to split a story into a time-boxed “spike” or “POC story” that will give the team enough information to make a decent estimate, and the rest of the story that will actually implement the desired feature.\n\n**Small**\n\nGood stories tend to be small. Stories typically represent at most a few person-days worth of work. Above this size it seems to become too hard to know what’s in the story’s scope. Smaller stories tend to get more accurate estimates. Story descriptions can be small too. Remember, the details can be elaborated through conversations with the customer.\n\n**Testable**\n\nA good story is testable. Writing a story carries an implicit promise: “I understand what I want well enough that I could write a test for it.” Several teams have reported that by requiring customer tests before implementing a story, the team is more productive. “Testability” has always been a characteristic of good requirements: actually writing the tests early helps us know whether this goal is met.\n\nIf a customer doesn’t know how to test something, this may indicate that the story isn’t clear enough, or that it doesn’t reflect something valuable to them, or that the customer just needs help in testing. A team can treat non-functional requirements (such as performance and usability) as things that need to be tested. Figuring out how to operationalize these tests will help the team learn the true needs.\n\nFor all these attributes, the feedback cycle of proposing, estimating, and implementing stories will help teach the team what it needs to know.\n\nHappy splitting everyone!\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThe following authors all inspired this blog post:\n\n[Mark J.

Along the way we try to engage different team members (designers, UX analysts, full-stack developers). Not only to create an experience that integrates with our current infrastructure and has a low entry barrier, but also to familiarize the team with blockchain in a fun and interactive way. We do have lunch sessions and internal excellence tracks, but nothing beats a real world, tangible example. We settled on two tasks to incentivize as starters: filling in timesheets on time and submitting/reviewing pull requests. The latter was an idea from our full stack team after one of our other internal excellence tracks.\n\n## A unique opportunity\n\nOne of the cool things about blockchain is that the technology has evolved from a payment system (e.g.; Bitcoin) to a full-fledged decentralized computer (e.g. Ethereum). This means that certain blockchains can be programmed with “smart contracts”, a set of conditions recorded on the blockchain so that transactions automatically trigger when the conditions are met. The code can not be changed once deployed onto the blockchain, as a result we do not have to trust a third party to reward us when we meet the conditions described in the contract.\n\nThis is exactly what we are doing with our programmable incentives; sending tokens after someone completes a pre-defined set of conditions that is known to tall parties involved.\n\nIncentives drive behaviour, (open) access to these programmable incentives sets a stage for potential change. We want to thus program incentives that promote positive outcomes in a trustless system: cooperation, equitability and morality.\n\n## Smart Contracts\n\nWe have created three main smarts contracts on our blockchain. The first smart contract, is our very own virtual currency, Knuckles! The knuckles will be our incentive for completing tasks. The smart contract will keep track of the token balances and contains logic for sending tokens to one another.\n\nThe second smart contract is a simple module that allows us to create and remove timesheet administrators, who can then verify and approve submitted timesheets. Users and their manager can see a historical list of processed timesheet periods and their rewards.\n\nOur third and final smart contract is slightly more complex: a bounty hunter game. Our employees already get paid for their work of course, thus the approach is slightly different from some bounties you might encounter in open source projects or open protocols. As a software company with multiple teams we use a versioning tool, called bitbucket, to better organize collaboration. Team members submit pull-requests to projects to upload new code. These requests need to be approved by someone on the team after a code review. When a pull requests gets approved a reward gets sent out to the reviewer for completing this nagging task. If the submitter did a great job and not too many changes are requested, he too gets rewarded.",component:"richtext",textalignment:"left",_editable:'\x3c!--#storyblok#{"name": "richtext", "space": "44470", "uid": "7b95b5e6-eeda-4938-8c2c-42627c60e72e", "id": "215737"}--\x3e'},{alt:"Blockchain pull requests",_uid:"07dc8caa-63ee-4d95-a2d7-9f18a7c0fe4c",image:"//a.storyblok.com/f/44470/644x493/c4782689c8/blockchain-pull-requests.png",width:"",alignment:"center",component:"imageupload",_editable:'\x3c!--#storyblok#{"name": "imageupload", "space": "44470", "uid": "07dc8caa-63ee-4d95-a2d7-9f18a7c0fe4c", "id": "215737"}--\x3e'},{_uid:"544d935c-6d0a-479e-b257-22da447e90e4",richtext:"## A Bounty Standard\n\nOne thing we’ve worked really hard on is standardizing our implemented features.

With this new power it is pretty straight forward to implement Angular components into AEM. In this blog post I will take you through the steps that are needed to implement Angular in an AEM codebase.\n\nI have created a [Github codebase](https://github.com/designisdead/ngx-aem) and tagged all the steps to follow along. I generated a default AEM project with the AEM Maven 11 archetype and added a new maven module called front-end which contains our angular weather component we want to integrate into AEM.

In our angular application we mimic the path where it will be on the AEM side. In this case I have chosen to upload my assets to **/etc/designs/ngx/assets**.\n\nNow that we have setup our angular app you can run it by executing the following commands:\n\n~~~\ncd front-end \nng serve\n~~~\n\n## 1. Exposing our component as a custom element\n\nThe first thing we need to do is expose our weather component as a custom element. To start we need to execute the following commands to get the libraries we need:\n\n~~~\nng add @angular/elements \nnpm install @webcomponents/custom-elements --save \nnpm install document-register-element@1.8.1 --save \n~~~\n\nThe first library will add the angular functionality to create custom elements, second library will add polyfills for the browsers that currently do not support custom elements. **Document-register-element** is a stand-alone lightweight version of Custom Elements V1 based on top, and compatible with, the battle-tested Custom Elements V0.\n\n> There is currently a bug in angular elements that it breaks if we try to use a higher version of document-register-element, but in the future, you should be able to use the latest versions.\n\nNext up we need to register the **WeatherComponent** as an **entryComponent** and add the following code to the class **AppModule**:\n\n~~~\nconstructor(private injector: Injector) {}  \n\nngDoBootstrap() {     \n  const weatherElement = createCustomElement(WeatherComponent,{\n    injector: this.injector \n  });     \n  \n  customElements.define(\'weather-ng\', <any>weatherElement); \n} \n~~~\n\nIn this code snippet we inject the angular **Injector** into our **AppModule** instance and register a lifecycle hook that will be called when angular is bootstrapping: **ngDoBootstrap()**. The method **createCustomElement** is part of the @angular/elements library. This method will basically create the correct code to be a custom element. After that follows **customElements.define** where we define what tag this custom element will have in this case it is **weather-ng**. The **customElements** object is available in all major browsers or through the polyfills.\n\nWhen you have done this, you can remove the **bootstrap** part of your module config and in your **index.html** use the tag **weather-ng**.\n\nTag for the code: [1-exposing-the-component](https://github.com/designisdead/ngx-aem/tree/1-exposing-the-component)\n\n## 2. Building and creating a clientlib\n\nThe next step is building our components and creating a clientlib from the exported files. I as well integrated the [maven front-end plugin](https://github.com/eirslett/frontend-maven-plugin) so we can use maven like the rest of the modules.\n\nFirst we need to add the following to the scripts part of the package.json.\n\n~~~\n"build:elements": "ng build --prod --output-hashing none && node elements-build.js" \n~~~\n\nThis npm script has two parts, the first part will build the Angular components production ready and with no output hashing. After that we use node.js to execute a javascript file. This file is the glue between Angular and AEM. The following code snipped it the **elements-build.js** file:\n\n~~~\nconst fs = require(\'fs-extra\');\r\nconst concat = require(\'concat\');\r\n(async function build() {\r\n  const files = [\r\n    \'./dist/front-end/runtime.js\',\r\n    \'./dist/front-end/polyfills.js\',\r\n    \'./dist/front-end/scripts.js\',\r\n    \'./dist/front-end/main.js\'\r\n  ];\r\n  \r\n  const rootDir = \'../ui.apps/src/main/content/jcr_root/etc/designs/ngx\';\r\n    \r\n  await fs.ensureDir(`${rootDir}/clientlib-site/js`);\r\n  await fs.ensureDir(`${rootDir}/clientlib-site/css`);\r\n    \r\n  await concat(files, `${rootDir}/clientlib-site/js/ng-aem.js`);\r\n  await fs.copyFile(\'./dist/front-end/styles.css\', `${rootDir}/clientlib-site/css/ng-aem.css`);\r\n    \r\n  await fs.copy(\'./dist/front-end/etc/designs/ngx/assets/\', `${rootDir}/assets`);\r\n  await fs.copy(\'./dist/front-end/weathericons-regular-webfont.eot\', `${rootDir}/clientlib-site/css/weathericons-regular-webfont.eot`);\r\n  await fs.copy(\'./dist/front-end/weathericons-regular-webfont.svg\', `${rootDir}/clientlib-site/css/weathericons-regular-webfont.svg`);\r\n  await fs.copy(\'./dist/front-end/weathericons-regular-webfont.ttf\', `${rootDir}/clientlib-site/css/weathericons-regular-webfont.ttf`);\r\n  await fs.copy(\'./dist/front-end/weathericons-regular-webfont.woff\', `${rootDir}/clientlib-site/css/weathericons-regular-webfont.woff`);\r\n    \r\n  await appendDataIfNotExists(`${rootDir}/clientlib-site/js.txt`, \'ng-aem.js\');\r\n  await appendDataIfNotExists(`${rootDir}/clientlib-site/css.txt`, \'ng-aem.css\');\r\n    \r\n  console.log("Done with moving angular libs to AEM");\r\n})();\r\n\r\nasync function appendDataIfNotExists(file, toAppend) {\r\n  const data = await fs.readFile(file, \'utf8\');\r\n  if (!data.split(\'\\n\').find((val) => val === toAppend)) {\r\n    await fs.writeFile(file,  data + \'\\n\' + toAppend);\r\n  }\r\n}\n~~~\n\nLet’s list up what this file does in bullet points:\n\n1. It checks if the correct folders exists with: **fs.ensureDir()**\n2. It concatenates all angular javascript files from the build and saves them at the clientlib position\n3. It copies the css file to the clientlib position\n4. It copies the assets to the correct directory\n5. It copies the weather icons font to the css clientlib position\n6. It checks and adds if the clientlib files are added to the **js.txt** and **css.txt**\n7. The last thing it does is log a message that we moved the angular files to AEM\n\nThe last thing to setup to make this process more complete is that we run this script when we run **mvn install**. To do this we use the front-end plugin and add the following configuration to the **pom.xml** of the **front-end** module:\n\n~~~\n<build>\r\n    <plugins>\r\n      <plugin>\r\n        <groupId>com.github.eirslett</groupId>\r\n        <artifactId>frontend-maven-plugin</artifactId>\r\n        <version>1.6</version>\r\n        <configuration>\r\n          <nodeVersion>v10.4.1</nodeVersion>\r\n        </configuration>\r\n        <executions>\r\n          <execution>\r\n            <id>install node and npm</id>\r\n            <goals>\r\n              <goal>install-node-and-npm</goal>\r\n            </goals>\r\n            <phase>generate-resources</phase>\r\n          </execution>\r\n          <execution>\r\n            <id>npm install</id>\r\n            <goals>\r\n              <goal>npm</goal>\r\n            </goals>\r\n            <phase>generate-resources</phase>\r\n            <configuration>\r\n              <arguments>install</arguments>\r\n            </configuration>\r\n          </execution>\r\n          <execution>\r\n            <id>npm run build custom elements</id>\r\n            <goals>\r\n              <goal>npm</goal>\r\n            </goals>\r\n            <phase>generate-resources</phase>\r\n            <configuration>\r\n              <arguments>run build:elements</arguments>\r\n            </configuration>\r\n          </execution>\r\n       </executions>\r\n     </plugin>\r\n  </plugins>\r\n</build>\n~~~\n\nThis configuration allows you when we use **mvn install** to download node.js and execute the **npm install** command, when this is done it will run the **build:elements** script.\n\nTag for the code: [2-building](https://github.com/designisdead/ngx-aem/tree/2-building)\n\n## 3. Creating the AEM component\n\nWhen we are done building our Angular component we can create an AEM component with it. The weather component in AEM will have a dialog with a selectbox where you can select ‘Kelvin’, ‘Celsius’ or ‘Farenheit’ to display in the weather component. We will as well make it that we can drag and drop other AEM components within our Angular component.\n\nFirst we create the **WeatherModel** sling model in the package **com.did.core.models** with the following code:\n\n~~~\n@Model(adaptables=Resource.class)\r\npublic class WeatherModel {\r\n    \r\n    @Inject\r\n    @Named("unitType")\r\n    @Default(values="")\r\n    private String unitType;\r\n    \r\n    public String getUnitType() {\r\n        return unitType;\r\n    }\r\n    public void setUnitType(String unitType) {\r\n        this.unitType = unitType;\r\n    }\r\n} \n~~~\n\nThe next code snippet is the selectbox part from the dialog:\n\n~~~\n<unitType jcr:primaryType="nt:unstructured" sling:resourceType="granite/ui/components/foundation/form/select" fieldLabel="Link Color" name="./unitType">\r\n  <items jcr:primaryType="nt:unstructured">\r\n    <default jcr:primaryType="nt:unstructured" text="Kelvin" value=""/>\r\n    <metric jcr:primaryType="nt:unstructured" text="Celcius" value="metric"/>\r\n    <imperial jcr:primaryType="nt:unstructured" text="Farenheit" value="imperial"/>\r\n  </items>\r\n</unitType>\n~~~\n\nThe last code snippet is from **weather-ng.html** and renders the component in author and publish mode:\n\n~~~\n<div data-sly-test="${wcmmode.edit}">\r\n    <h3>Drag here the components you want to display in your weather component</h3>\r\n    <div data-sly-resource="${\'content\' @ resourceType=\'wcm/foundation/components/parsys\'}"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<weather-ng data-sly-test="${wcmmode.disabled}" data-sly-use.weather="com.did.core.models.WeatherModel" unit="${weather.unitType}">\r\n    <div data-sly-resource="${\'content\' @  resourceType=\'wcm/foundation/components/parsys\'}"></div>\r\n</weather-ng>\n~~~\n\nIn the HTML we have two parts, the first part is when we are on an Author environment. We do not show our angular component here, but we do offer the option to add components to the page within our weather component.\n\nThe second part is only shown when wcm mode is disabled, here you can see our custom element working. The Angular input in the weather component is now an attribute on the element, so we use this to pass the AEM Component config to our Angular component.',component:"richtext",textalignment:"left",_editable:'\x3c!--#storyblok#{"name": "richtext", "space": "44470", "uid": "7b95b5e6-eeda-4938-8c2c-42627c60e72e", "id": "214837"}--\x3e'},{alt:"Authoring in AEM",_uid:"07dc8caa-63ee-4d95-a2d7-9f18a7c0fe4c",image:"//a.storyblok.com/f/44470/1920x1080/0996a4676a/ng-aem_author.png",width:"",alignment:"center",component:"imageupload",_editable:'\x3c!--#storyblok#{"name": "imageupload", "space": "44470", "uid": "07dc8caa-63ee-4d95-a2d7-9f18a7c0fe4c", "id": "214837"}--\x3e'},{_uid:"544d935c-6d0a-479e-b257-22da447e90e4",richtext:"This is the Author view, you can see on the left that we have our **Weather Component**.

Time to draw my conclusion of integration Angular 6+ into AEM.\n\nI think that it is a success, you can have all the nice features of Angular 6+ and AEM altogether. I mainly liked that I could develop without spinning up my AEM instance unit all the front-end code was done. Through the power of custom elements, it integrates rather easy with AEM. The size of our clientlib is reasonable as well with **268,8 KB** which can be made smaller by using the GZIP feature of AEM clientlibs.\n\nIn the future I will for sure use Angular 6+ again for more complex components in AEM.",component:"richtext",textalignment:"left",_editable:'\x3c!--#storyblok#{"name": "richtext", "space": "44470", "uid": "eab091f3-1b85-4409-908a-1743a1bcb61d", "id": "214837"}--\x3e'}],component:"wrapper",textcolor:"",backgroundsize:"auto",backgroundcolor:"",backgroundimage:"",backgroundposition:"",_editable:'\x3c!--#storyblok#{"name": "wrapper", "space": "44470", "uid": "f44b2854-1b24-4c5a-aa64-e649dc63c860", "id": "214837"}--\x3e'}],author:214870,component:"post",published:"2018-05-09 00:00",primaryimage:"//a.storyblok.com/f/44470/1200x700/cfd7239a2a/angular-in-aem.png",metadescription:"This blog post describes how to use angular 6+ with custom elements in Adobe Experience Manager",_editable:'\x3c!--#storyblok#{"name": "post", "space": "44470", "uid": "e8c7c074-0496-46e2-bb3b-76a4c49536aa", "id": "214837"}--\x3e'},slug:"angular6-in-aem",full_slug:"blog/angular6-in-aem",sort_by_date:null,position:-210,tag_list:[],is_startpage:!1,parent_id:129791,meta_data:null,group_id:"d13c7ff9-82a0-4748-873c-6faf91001c44"},{name:"Adobe Summit 2018 – An EXPERIENCE and three take aways",created_at:"2018-08-22T13:17:59.314Z",published_at:"2018-08-22T13:50:49.898Z",alternates:[],id:214803,uuid:"d64899d0-2ecf-46d5-b957-abb00f8dc72d",content:{_uid:"e8c7c074-0496-46e2-bb3b-76a4c49536aa",body:[{_uid:"f44b2854-1b24-4c5a-aa64-e649dc63c860",size:"medium",elements:[{_uid:"adda2271-96d3-492a-9ba4-1fd5ea998249",richtext:"Four of our [best warriors](http://www.designisdead.com/team/) visited a beloved arena for the Emakina Group: Adobe Summit 2018 @ Excel London.

But let’s face it, every company should celebrate their accomplishments together with their partners, customers and prospects… because behind every accomplishment there is an experience, an interaction, a story to share and to learn from.\n\nThere were plenty of break-out sessions on new product features like for AEM and Campaign, several global brands presented how they optimize their customer experience and finally there were sessions on future trends.\n\n> It is really impressive to see how Adobe Sensei is already empowering all modules of the Experience Cloud. On the summit AI became really tangible. It is not a prediction anymore, today AI is reality. We are only at the beginning, but even the sky doesn’t seem to be the limit. – Jeroen Huys\n\n## Alignment with our vision\n\n### Certainty as a service\n\nThis concept, empowered by blockchain, reassured all the investment and efforts that we are making enabling this technology for our customers. You can also check our [blogpost](http://www.designisdead.com/blog/another-blogpost-you-guessed-it-about-blockchain) about blockchain.\n\nIn this context, we are also happy to share our joint collaboration with [Nico Vergauwen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicovergauwen/), Blockchain consultant and founder of [Alt Street](https://altstreet.io/), expert in Smart contracts, Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technology will help our customers to reach the next level of certainty and transparency.\n\nJust contact us if you want to understand better how blockchain can empower your business models.\n\n### DevOps Deciphered\n\nAdobe shared some lessons learned that they observed in some companies that failed applying DevOps and why we should sometimes refer to Development-Operations teams (doing development and giving operational support) instead of using the term DevOps teams.\n\n> Some applications are not suited for DevOps practices. Instead of spending huge amounts of money trying to convert these monolithic products into something flexible (and probably fail after all), you might want to concentrate on decoupling your entire stack as much as possible. This way, you can embrace DevOps in the applications where it’s really useful and where most business value resides, which is typically in the front-end layer. – Johnny Degreef\n\nThey also shared about the CALMS framework, often used in companies that want to adopt DevOps as part of their digital transformation. DevOps is not just about technology or automation, it is much more, and it has to start from a change in culture.\n\n### Adobe Managed Services\n\nAccording to Adobe, 75% of their customers (and they have 600+ customers) are running AEM successfully on Adobe Managed Services (AMS). With Managed Services, Adobe runs and maintains your AEM stack in the cloud and they take care of code deployments, upgrades, … It is very mature and a logical next step for companies still having their AEM running on-premise. The figures pointed out 99,97% uptime average, 8000+ AEM servers managed in a Multi Cloud (Azure & AWS) set-up.\n\nAdobe Managed Services comes with NewRelic as Application Performance Monitoring (APM) tool. This is a cloud tool that **we also use for our customers and we can only applaud that choice.**\n\nKey message in this session was to define your KPI’s clearly from the start of the project. What do want to get out of it? Is it about cost saving or is it more about outsourcing control which is not part of your core business? Depending on these KPI’s, you can decide to go for it, stay on-premise or move to the Cloud without AMS and still stay in control.\n\n### Experience – Technology – Talent\n\n*Making experience your business is good for business.* In order to accomplish this, you need to have the correct **technologies** in place. For this purpose, Adobe has added a new tool built on the Adobe Cloud Platform called Adobe Launch. Launch is the next-generation of Adobe’s tag management technology and you might want to have a look at it. But technology alone does not suffice, you also need to have the right **talent** on board. Attracting talents is probably the biggest challenge in this fast-evolving digital age. And by coincidence, this is the heart of Design Is Dead. We have succeeded in attracting the right talents that can implement the right technology to deliver the right customer experience.\n\n## Take-aways from the summit\n\n1/ The Adobe Summit was again the confirmation and an example to follow regarding digital transformation journeys… Wow! It is admirable to see how Adobe evolved from a graphical solution provider for desktop to an Experience Technology leader provider as pointed out in reports such as Gartner and Forrester. Their organic and inorganic growth strategy is well balanced. They are taking advantage of their marketing knowledge and succeeding at integrating the solutions they acquired (e.g.: Neolane, Day). Well done Adobe!\n\n2/ Experience is everything. And even though during the conference it was (almost) all about the digital experience, it is clear that a company should deliver an overall on- and offline experience. The insights from Virgin Atlantic during the keynote on Thursday is the best proof of this. Deliver the best possible experience (even a small one like a ‘happy birthday’ card on the seat of a passenger), and your brand will grow as well as the customer loyalty. And, definitely, your employees will be happier. Win-win-win-… in every way!\n\nAdobe even launched a new job title! If you want to become an Experience Maker, you can visit their new platform [Experience League](https://landing.adobe.com/experience-league/).\n\n![](http://www.designisdead.com/img/experiencemakers.jpg)\n\n3/ AI is not a hype, it is here to stay, and Adobe is a heavy believer of it. Adobe Sensei is an artificial intelligent system that focusses on making the live of marketeers and creatives easier. Don’t ask Sensei to solve all world problems but will definitely help you to optimize your communication and automate your online presence.\n\n> This summit blew my mind! It had all the necessary ingredients to trigger many thoughts around the current trends in the market and I started wondering: will AI systems take over all parts of the creative and marketing process?

This hierarchy will allow you to have a clear view of all your marketing automated actions. Reports can be built aggregating data of the deliveries and showing performance at the level of program and campaign.\n\nThirdly, the power that Campaign Standard has to integrate with other systems. Workflows enable users to set up data transformation processes to add new profiles or new transactions. Via [FTP or SFTP](https://helpx.adobe.com/campaign/standard/automating/using/transfer-file.html), Campaign can connect to third party servers, download a file, transform the format and store the data in the data store.\n\nAdobe Campaign Standard has a very powerful system to build APIs without any coding know ledge.

Here are some of our take aways.*\n\n## Hustlers\n\nThat’s what Kenyans call 83% of the population in contrast of the 17% that has a monthly paycheck in Kenya. These hustlers need an entrepreneurial spirit by necessity.\n\nThat part of their cultural DNA was very strongly present when I talked to them during the visit and it is a good fit for the startup mentality.\n\n## Mobile\n\nThere are things Kenya beats the entire world. 83% percent of the total internet traffic comes over mobile devices. An anecdote of one of the mission participants highlighted that some Kenyan are even amazed if they learn you can surf the web via a desktop or laptop.\n\nMobile payments are ubiquitous amongst the people who have a cellphone, most of which are still using a sms-toolkit.   \nAbsolute market leader in those Mobile Payment is Safricom’s M-Pesa (literally Mobile Money)\n\n## Handling a day by day budget\n\nMost Kenyans cannot afford making investments to improve their life, like getting on the electricity grid or even a small solar panel.\n\nThat’s why most startups have some kind of payment plan after which the product becomes the ownership of the subscriber.  \nSee for example [M-Kopa Solar](http://www.m-kopa.com/) and [PayGo Energy](https://www.paygoenergy.co/) who want to help Kenyans go away from buying small amounts of low quality kerosine for their energy needs.\n\n## Bridging the divide\n\nThis is the slogan of our partner Close the Gap and most startups are actually helping with that mission through entrepreneurship. The obvious tool is education which Close the Gap enables by providing ICT material to for instance Computers for School Kenya and designing digitrucks (see top image).  \nStartups active in this category are [Kytabu](http://kytabu.com/) (digitizing school books) and [Ewela](http://elewa.co.ke/) (changing the education approach).\n\n[Sophiebot](http://sophiebot.tk/) addresses one of the more challenging topics to be handled in the classroom: sexual reproductive health. Fuelled by artificial intelligence is has a direct positive impact on a major health issue in the region.\n\nHaving an address seems normal to us in the western world and we don’t realize that not having one could be the difference between life or death when an ambulance can not find your location. That is what [OkHi](http://www.okhi.com/) aims to solve. A drought can have a massive impact on the yield of crops, what if we can activate the natural response system of those crops so they are more resilient. [Fyteko](http://fyteko.com/) does exactly that.\n\nThis was an inspiring experience to a part of the world that is still sometimes overlooked when it comes to digital innovation, clearly unrightfully so. We would like to thank our partner [Close the Gap](http://close-the-gap.org/) and [Startups.be](https://startups.be/) for organising the Mission and given us the opportunity to participate.\n\nIf you like to see some pictures and learn more check our [facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/DesignisDead/) for the daily posts we did.

Personalisation is a must to engage with your audience.*\n\nI worked as a researcher since 2005 till 1015 in the world of Technology Enhanced Learning. Yes, this field is about how to improve learning using technology. I can still remember my first project: [TENCOMPETENCE](https://www.openeducationeuropa.eu/en/project/tencompetence). Already then, words such as “personalisation” and “adaptation” were constantly used during the project. We all shared the dream of fully personalised learning journeys for every student, every person, for the rest of their lives: lifelong learning. But I must say that the access that marketing has nowadays is hardly comparable to what we had access at that moment.\n\nWe will avoid going into semantics as we can start a whole dissertation discussing the differences between personalisation and adaptation can be understood differently. In this [paper](http://info.iicm.tu-graz.ac.at/www/Research/Publications/2005/_id187c3_/iknow05_personalisation/iknow05_personalisation.pdf), some folks from the University of Graz define personalisation as part of adaptation, and in this [blog](https://devnet.kentico.com/articles/personalization-101--types-of-personalization), [Thomas Robbins](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thom-robbins-7888486/) working with [Kentico](https://www.kentico.com/) at that moment and now Chief Marketing Manager of MediaPro, defined adaptation as a type of personalisation.\n\nThomas Robbins explains that we have two/three types of personalisation:\n\n* Prescriptive personalisation: Prescriptive personalization is rule based and triggered by interactions with a user.\n  * Explicit personalisation: Personalisation is done based on the data of the user profile.\n  * Implicit personalisation: We still have rules but are based on the behaviour of the user (e.g. clicks, visited resources, …)\n* Adaptive personalisation: In this one, we take some distance from rule-based personalisation and we dive into automatic personalisation based on behaviour prediction.\n\nMost of the DXP support explicit personalisation nowadays. Less DXP support implicit personalisation and even less support adaptive personalisation.\n\nWith Adobe Experience Cloud we have the right tooling to experiment and make progress on this journey as I partially explained in my last blog post: “[Enabling marketing experimentation with Adobe Target](http://www.designisdead.com/blog/enabling-marketing-experimentation-with-adobe-target)”.\n\nAdobe Experience Cloud enables you to start from a simple explicit personalisation and accompanies you in the journey towards fully adaptive personalisation.\n\nHow can a journey for your company?\n\n1. You can start with Adobe Experience Manager and [ContextHub](https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/6-3/sites/developing/using/contexthub.html) (out-of-the-box functionality).\n\nThis functionality enables to hook up your CRM or your user profile database to\timport your segments and personalise your content. At this level, we would be at the level of explicit personalisation. This is the level supported by most of the CMSs.\n\n1. The second natural step is Adobe Target. With Adobe target, you can perform [A/B and multivariate testing](http://www.designisdead.com/blog/enabling-marketing-experimentation-with-adobe-target). Adobe Target has a functionality that is “[Auto-allocate](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/target/target/automated_traffic_allocation.html)” that determines the winner of your experiment and automatically reallocates more traffic to the most successful scenario.\n\nYou can also use audience data collected by [Analytics](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/target/target/c_audiences.html) for real-time targeting and personalization in Adobe Target.\n\nAt this level, we could say that we are doing something similar to implicit personalisation, especially, when we plug Analytics data.\n\n1. The third step is to disclose the full potential of Adobe Target and its [automated personalisation features](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/target/target/t_automated_personalization.html) using [Random Forest](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/target/beta/target/c_algo_random_forest.html) to predict user behaviour.\n\nYou can also read a bit further here about [products recommendations](http://www.adobe.com/be_en/marketing-cloud/target/product-recommendations.html) and [automated personalisation](http://www.adobe.com/be_en/marketing-cloud/target/automated-personalization.html).\n\nAt this level, we would be clearly talking about adaptive personalisation.\n\nOnce the last step is reached, you might find the challenge of providing enough quality for all your personas. As discussed by [Bridget Roman](https://theblog.adobe.com/adobe-target-aem-livefyre-help-win-personalization-game-every-time/), senior product marketing manager for Adobe Experience Manager Livefyre, many companies do not have neither the budget nor the time to generate enough content quality to address all the customer segments that they have. Therefore, mastering user generated content can become a really valuable asset to engage but also to provide personalised experiences that consequently will raise the engagement. Livefyre can be a clear differentiator for your business when you use it correctly.\n\nIf you want to continue the discussion about all the possibilities of the Adobe Experience Cloud, do not hesitate to [contact me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jlsantoso/)!",component:"richtext",textalignment:"left",_editable:'\x3c!--#storyblok#{"name": "richtext", "space": "44470", "uid": "adda2271-96d3-492a-9ba4-1fd5ea998249", "id": "214476"}--\x3e'}],component:"wrapper",textcolor:"",backgroundsize:"auto",backgroundcolor:"",backgroundimage:"",backgroundposition:"",_editable:'\x3c!--#storyblok#{"name": "wrapper", "space": "44470", "uid": "f44b2854-1b24-4c5a-aa64-e649dc63c860", "id": "214476"}--\x3e'}],author:135060,component:"post",published:"2018-02-27 00:00",primaryimage:"//a.storyblok.com/f/44470/1280x853/e1bbabf4c9/adobe-experience-cloud-customer-journeys.jpg",metadescription:"According to L2 research, users spend 40% more time on average on websites that provide personalised experiences and these companies manage to decrease 17% their bounce rates on average.

With the right tooling (e.g. Adobe Target), process (e.g. SCRUM) and planning tool (e.g. JIRA), you can start your endeavour in the experimentation world.*\n\nExperimentation is an inherent part of data driven marketing. Most of the DXP platforms have content targeting functionality. But many marketers face the frustration that once they target their content, they do not achieve the expected engagement. Surely, they can re-target their content again and see if the second time they are luckier. They might learn from the experience, but next time, they might fail again because the lessons learned were not the right ones.\n\nI am a big fan of the website called [Spurious correlations](http://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations). We can see quite funny correlations there such as US spending on science, space and technology and the suicides by hanging, strangulation and suffocation. Those analyses confirm the danger of data misuse as well as the well-known rule that correlation doesn’t mean causality. Such a website pushes correlations out of the common-sense limits. However, we can constantly see people experimenting with designs and comparing unrelated data.\n\nContextual information is vital for the correct analysis of data. And, if we want to minimise the impact of the context, we should conduct more formal experiments.\n\nProbably you are familiar with the A/B and multivariate testing. Nowadays we have wonderful tools that allow you to experiment. Our favourite is [Adobe Target](http://www.adobe.com/be_en/marketing-cloud/target/ab-testing.html), but indeed, you can check also others such as [VWO](https://vwo.com/ab-testing/).\n\nAnd why do we like Adobe? Well… you know about our weakness for JAVA. Our DXP of choice is Adobe Experience Manager (AEM), a JAVA product. AEM integrates flawlessly with products from the Adobe Experience Cloud such as Target and Analytics. But most importantly, we can bring our expertise building JAVA middleware layers to communicate with other components, activity that our developers thrive for it. Reactive programming, functional programming and other paradigms are increasing the possibilities within the JAVA landscape.\n\n### What do I personally like Adobe Target?\n\nThe possibilities of setting up your own experiments. For example, you can try your new design with only 20% of your visitors. But Adobe target can automatically adapt this percentage based on the success of your experiment, ending targeting the best content to the right audience.\n\nHow powerful is when plugged in with [Adobe Analytics](http://www.adobe.com/be_en/marketing-cloud/target/analytics-enhanced-reporting.html). You can target one audience for your specific experiment as well as getting enhanced reports thanks to the information of both components.\n\n### How do we learn from it?\n\nBesides the lack of rigorous analysis, there is usually another common problem. Marketing teams lack a process to share knowledge, a space where design, reasoning and findings of the experiments can be discussed. And let’s admit it, this is sometimes difficult even in research environments.\n\nIn this context, we recommend agile frameworks such as SCRUM that can give windows of 1, 2 or 4 weeks for marketing teams to experiment. We also suggest the use of a log book. Software such as JIRA offers the possibility to fully customise your tickets.\n\nTherefore, with the right tooling (e.g. Adobe Target), process (e.g. SCRUM) and planning tool (e.g. JIRA), marketing teams can start their endeavour in their experimentation world.\n\nAny questions? Just ask.\n\n*This is part of a series of posts that we started with “[2018, an exciting year](http://www.designisdead.com/blog/2008-an-exciting-year)” and “[Another blogpost –you guessed it- about Blockchain](http://www.designisdead.com/blog/another-blogpost-you-guessed-it-about-blockchain)”*\n\n## Log Book example",component:"richtext",textalignment:"left",_editable:'\x3c!--#storyblok#{"name": "richtext", "space": "44470", "uid": "adda2271-96d3-492a-9ba4-1fd5ea998249", "id": "214474"}--\x3e'},{alt:"Logbook",_uid:"63548da7-fcd4-449d-b982-220599ee0f4d",image:"//a.storyblok.com/f/44470/918x986/862f9b706f/logbook.png",width:"",alignment:"center",component:"imageupload",_editable:'\x3c!--#storyblok#{"name": "imageupload", "space": "44470", "uid": "63548da7-fcd4-449d-b982-220599ee0f4d", "id": "214474"}--\x3e'}],component:"wrapper",textcolor:"",backgroundsize:"auto",backgroundcolor:"",backgroundimage:"",backgroundposition:"",_editable:'\x3c!--#storyblok#{"name": "wrapper", "space": "44470", "uid": "f44b2854-1b24-4c5a-aa64-e649dc63c860", "id": "214474"}--\x3e'}],author:135060,component:"post",published:"2018-02-06 00:00",primaryimage:"//a.storyblok.com/f/44470/1920x786/5b103d3b55/experimentation.jpg",metadescription:"Fail faster, succeed sooner.

The design [dialog configuration node](https://github.com/inventj/AEM63-Style-System-demo/blob/master/ui.apps/src/main/content/jcr_root/apps/aem63/components/content/announcement/_cq_design_dialog/.content.xml)enables the component to have a policy.\n\nPay special attention to the *styletab* node in the *cq:design_dialog*…\n\n~~~\n<styletab\n  jcr:primaryType="nt:unstructured"\n  sling:resourceType="granite/ui/components/coral/foundation/include"\n  path="/mnt/overlay/cq/gui/components/authoring/dialog/style/tab_design/styletab"/> \n~~~\n\n…this piece of configuration is needed to make the styles work on core v1.0 components or your custom component.

But it’s far from reality. Blockchain is more than cryptocurrency. \n\nIn this world, with a very strong movement in favour of healthier food consumption, blockchain is penetrating strongly. We can find several examples in the food industry such as:\n\n* [Provenance](https://www.provenance.org/whitepaper) : a website that proposes Blockchain as the solution for transparency in product supply chains.\n* [ZhongAn](https://www.fastcompany.com/40515999/in-china-you-can-track-your-chicken-on-you-guessed-it-the-blockchain) : besides inspiring us for the title, this article explains how ZhongAn developed this blockchain technology to track the origin of the chickens.\n* [WWF](https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/100386866/wwf-uses-blockchain-to-improve-transparency-in-tuna-industry): Same than ZhongAn, but proposing the tracking of tuna.\n\n*So what is happening in Belgium?*\n\n* Vrije Universiteit Brussel started their own project: [NRGcoin](http://www.nrgcoin.org/) — Smart Contract for green energy.\n* [WeTrade](https://we-trade.com/): and indeed, it’s about trading. And KBC is playing a role there.\n* [Port of Antwerp](http://www.t-mining.be/): where they are using to track that containers end up in the hands of the rightful truck driver.\n\nSome people though argues that Belgium might be lagging behind in BlockChain projects. You can check this enriching [discussion](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6347361282617860098/) started by Laurens van Reiijen.\n\nBut this is not all… we recently learned that IBM and Danish shipping giant Maersk are starting a [New York-based venture](http://fortune.com/2018/01/16/ibm-blockchain-maersk-company/).\n\nLong story short, Blockchain is about tracing the story of something in a transparent, uncorrupted and reliable way.\n\nDo you need a deeper understanding of the technology?

We can surely identify the traditional cost optimisation, but the main focus is increasing the profit and revenue of the company.\n\nThe same report explains how the CIO is becoming the **liaison** between business departments and an enabler of the digital transformation. This explains why growing the market share and enabling digital transformation are on the top.\n\n[Adobe’s CMO survey](https://cmosurvey.org/results) reports a **CMO** who is assuming more responsibilities within the company.\n\nThe following priorities are identified in the survey: 1) the acquisition of new customers; 2) increase the customer purchase volume; 3) purchase of related products and services; 4) customer retention; 5) entry of new customers into market; and 6) price per unit.\n\nSurely, these priorities shift by industries and markets. For example, we see that manufacturing and services will focus on increasing the customer purchase volume. Obviously, those industries that have a low conversion rate and high acquisition costs will focus on maximising accounts instead of acquiring new ones.\n\n*How is Design is Dead going to help companies in 2018?*\n\n* Enabling **scientific experimentation** for marketing departments\n* Enabling personalised journeys with **AEM**\n* Becoming an enabler for customers who want to dive into technologies such as **Blockchain, Machine Learning, Big Data and IoT**\n\nAnd we will make sure to expand every point in the following blog posts.\n\nAny question?

Three brave souls of the DID team wrestled through all the defence scripts to find their favourite projects to attend and participate as jury. So on Monday 19/06, Wednesday 21/06 and Friday 23/06 each of us attended 5 very diverse and very interesting defences going from pure software development to drones, domotics and server management. After all defences we participated to the deliberation and provided our score and motivation.\n\nAs our next mission in the battle for new talent, we are also attending and organising meetups.

Before, your seniority was mainly measured by the number of certificates you received. Today it is no longer the only tool to determine if a candidate will deliver what he promises.\n\n## Improved recruitment at Design Is Dead\n\nAt Design Is Dead, recruitment has shifted gears. We aim to make the recruitment as light as possible.\n\n1. Candidates submit their application.\n2. If the candidate claims to have experience and knowledge in his CV, we invite the candidate for an interview.\n3. We usually conduct a very informal interview, but technical questions are asked while the candidate is discussing her/his CV. Therefore, the technical questions are related to real use cases that the candidate faced. We can assess her or his skills to explain the problem, the thinking process to find a solution, and the technical knowledge acquired after the process.\n\nThe interview proved to be a valuable tool to assess the fit of the candidate. However, the process gets more complicated when you see that based on purely skills, the candidate is not the right match, but s/he has the right attitude and shows a lot of potential.\n\nIf both parts believe that they can still be a match, the candidate receives an open assignment with little requirements, for instance a REST API written in Java and consumed in a javascript framework of choice. The candidate gets a few weeks to solve this.\n\nAfter submission of the project and review by a few senior team members, the candidate is invited for a second interview to have a discussion on the work he delivered, how he tackled any problems he encountered and how he dealt with new things. Questions go deep to get a better idea of the understanding of the topic at hand, and we, proactively, give feedback to the candidate.\n\nIn the end, why shouldn’t an interview be a learning experience?\n\nThis approach has allowed us to find some promising candidates. During the interview, the candidate has to put his money where his mouth is. And, even if the candidate fails, we can contribute to her or his learning process.\n\nAs [Jeroen](https://be.linkedin.com/in/jeroenhuys) (the boss ;)) says, it is all about people and as a company we should aim to have (in addition to results) a positive impact on the society at large.\n\n## What has this to do with certification?\n\nI have a background as a tutor at the engineering faculty of a Belgian university. In this function, I examined students on their final projects. The final mark was based on the delivered work, but also on the understanding of the covered material during an oral examination. Over the years I developed a sixth sense to distinguish the shy but intelligent student from the loud and nonsense type. It has been proven that only a written exam does not give a complete overview of skills and knowledge of each student.\n\nEvery single time I did a certification exam, I managed to pass, just barely but I passed. Every time I exited the testing center, I felt underrated because these exams do not include a practical part, just like the hiring process or the evaluations I used to do at the university. These exams only test the knowledge you know by heart. So anyone with a great memory but low understanding of the subject has a reasonable chance to pass the certification exam.\n\n## What’s the alternative?\n\nThat’s a hard one. Having a one-to-one conversation as part of the certification is very intensive, both for the examiner and the examinee. It is also expensive for the company issuing the certification. And finally, these assignments are hard to re-use. Believe me, students are experts in compiling all exam assignments of the past years.\n\nAn other approach is how we do things at Design Is Dead. A certification is considered as proof of knowledge. In a interview we check how the candidate applied his knowledge in the past and how he will solve problems using his aquired knowledge.\n\nNevertheless, it is worthwhile to rethink the certification process. Although computer-based tests are time-savers, they still miss some part of the skills of the candidate.",component:"richtext",textalignment:"left",_editable:'\x3c!--#storyblok#{"name": "richtext", "space": "44470", "uid": "adda2271-96d3-492a-9ba4-1fd5ea998249", "id": "214302"}--\x3e'}],component:"wrapper",textcolor:"",backgroundsize:"auto",backgroundcolor:"",backgroundimage:"",backgroundposition:"",_editable:'\x3c!--#storyblok#{"name": "wrapper", "space": "44470", "uid": "f44b2854-1b24-4c5a-aa64-e649dc63c860", "id": "214302"}--\x3e'}],author:214303,component:"post",published:"2017-08-28 00:00",primaryimage:"//a.storyblok.com/f/44470/920x656/3a0e2b2237/please-update-certification-procedure.jpg",metadescription:"All kind of processes have evolved over time, but certification is not one of them.",_editable:'\x3c!--#storyblok#{"name": "post", "space": "44470", "uid": "e8c7c074-0496-46e2-bb3b-76a4c49536aa", "id": "214302"}--\x3e'},slug:"please-update-the-certification-procedure",full_slug:"blog/please-update-the-certification-procedure",sort_by_date:null,position:-110,tag_list:[],is_startpage:!1,parent_id:129791,meta_data:null,group_id:"26aa02f6-55b1-4943-9e21-30f600f721a3"},{name:"The challenge: omnichannel experiences",created_at:"2018-08-22T07:18:31.132Z",published_at:"2018-08-22T13:50:50.224Z",alternates:[],id:214300,uuid:"c6ee6457-600f-4d02-a2ac-c228bfe3f5a6",content:{_uid:"e8c7c074-0496-46e2-bb3b-76a4c49536aa",body:[{_uid:"f44b2854-1b24-4c5a-aa64-e649dc63c860",size:"medium",elements:[{_uid:"adda2271-96d3-492a-9ba4-1fd5ea998249",richtext:"Last week was exciting at Design is Dead. We interviewed many UX designers for one of our new positions. We were looking for a creative, but also functional thinking candidate. Someone who designs fancy, but doable interfaces.\n\nI personally got impressed when getting the explanation of [Atomic Design](http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/) from one of our candidates. He showed passion while he was explaining it and he definitely wanted to capture my attention.\n\nHowever, it was a bit surprising that nobody raised any framework or data-informed approach to the question: how do you start the design of an interface?\n\nThere is a big debate about the [downsides](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/data-informed-design-data-driven-neil-turner) of relying only on data. However, sometimes it scares me that we leave our decisions to our gut feelings instead of structuring better our thinking process.\n\nIn my opinion, the UX designs are most of the times the real start of the requirements. That’s the reason why we usually recommend to our customers start with a workshop.\n\nThe design thinking process is becoming very popular. But, in the definition of the problem, we recommend to spend time on the metrics that we‘ll track after the product launch. I know I know… as the folks from UX studio share, sometimes we also do it after launching the product. Sometimes, the clients do not want this kind of brainstorming earlier and they want the product.\n\nWhen defining the metrics, it is always better to rely on existing frameworks. For that, the [HEART framework](https://library.gv.com/how-to-choose-the-right-ux-metrics-for-your-product-5f46359ab5be) is a very useful tool. It helps us to focus on the priorities, but, even more important, at which stage we can start evaluating the product. Specially, when we can involve end-customers at early stage of the product and we start talking about CX instead of UX.\n\nThis process helps us to put especial emphasis on the call to actions and prioritise goals. I loved the article from [Tom Goodwin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomfgoodwin) entitled [“Is data killing advertisement?”](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/data-killing-advertising-tom-goodwin).\n\n> “Attribution should be about establishing success and growing the business. However, the entire practice has become about capturing — not creating — success.” — [Tom Goodwin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomfgoodwin)\n\nAnd finally, we raise the final questions: Where does the customer journey start? How can we provide seamless customer journeys jumping from one channel to another?

It also adds the agency clients and goodwill of its Antwerp-based sister company of Emakina Group. Design is Dead is very much alive and kicking and now fully focuses on enterprise platform integration, application building and ICT-advice.\n\nThe integration of the 20 coworkers of the creative cell is a logical step for both organisations, after successful joint projects on clients like Bekaert, Auping and LolaLiza. The Reference strengthens its full service digital offering with extra conceptual and creative talents who deliver bold communication for brands as Ann Demeulemeester, Come a casa, Concertgebouw Brugge, Jules Destrooper, Brugge Tripel and Auping. This team now becomes part of a bigger international venture, with top experts in digital-first multichannel services and technologies.\n\nThe digital team of Design is Dead in Brussels is no part of this integration. The 25 ICT professionals each have over 10 years of experience in the development and maintenance of enterprise web applications. They work in agile teams with a relentless focus on DevOps. MD Jeroen Huys autonomously expands this line of business under the current brand name Design is Dead.\n\nWith the Design is Dead creative power joining in, the company headquartered in Ghent now grows to 140 consultants in total, operating from three locations. Besides the economy of scale and obvious synergies between the talented teams, the positive ‘click’ between the people involved made this a logical and natural decision. Also, clients react enthusiastically as they can clearly see the added value of the joint expertise.\n\n### Anja Cappelle, MD of The Reference:\n\n“We wish a warm welcome to our Antwerp colleagues! Together we will generate high tangible business results for our clients. I look forward to seeing our combined skills and energy at work, at the intersection of marketing and technology. After opening our New York office, this is a new milestone for our company: this integration makes us stronger than ever, our united future is bright.”\n\n### Jeroen Huys, MD of Design is Dead:\n\n“The Reference will be ideal context for our creative colleagues to fully develop their talents and put them at the disposal of interesting clients. We wish them all the best. For Design is Dead a new chapter begins, one that we have already been silently writing with a lot of success for the last 10 years. As a reliable enterprise solutions partner we are ready to share our vast experience with top organizations looking for IT advise, platform integration & full stack custom built Java development.”\n\n#### About THE REFERENCE\n\nIt’s more than digital, it’s your business.
